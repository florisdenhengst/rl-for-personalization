Previous work using reinforcement learning (RL) has addressed personalised tutoring from the perspective of affective policy learning. In …
Personalized Attention-Aware Exposure Control Using Reinforcement Learning|http://scholar.google.com/https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02269|2018|0|2|None|None|None|http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16088264069985027389&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5|None|We propose a reinforcement learning approach for real-time exposure control of a mobile camera that is personalizable. Our approach is based on Markov Decision Process (MDP). In the camera viewfinder or live preview mode, given the current frame, our system predicts …
