0,1,1,1,1,Personalized automatic image annotation based on reinforcement learning,"With the rapidly increasing number of personal image collections on the web, it is of great importance to annotate these user-uploaded images in personalized manner. But personalized image annotation is largely ignored by the mainstream of image annotation research. In this paper, we focus on personalizing the automatic image annotation by proposing a general framework which jointly exploits the generic content-based image annotation, personal image tagging history and the content of personal history images. In our framework, two sets of candidate annotations are extracted for each image based on content-based annotation and personal image tagging history. Considering that the user's interest may not stay the same, when exploiting the personal image tagging history, we also take the content of personal history images into account to avoid the noise. To get the final annotations, we propose an unsupervised algorithm based on reinforcement learning to combine the above two candidate annotation sets. Encouraging results show that the proposed framework is effective and promising for personalizing automatic image annotation.","With the rapidly increasing number of personal image collections on the web, it is of great importance to annotate these user-uploaded images in personalized manner.

1,1,1,1,1,Automatically Learning User Preferences for Personalized Service Composition,"With the rapid growth of the web services technologies, users often leverage various web services to perform their daily activities, such as on-line shopping. Due to the massive amount of web services available, a user faces numerous choices to meet their personal preferences when selecting the desired services from the web services with the similar functionality. Therefore, it becomes tedious and cumbersome tasks for users to discover and compose services. To reduce user's cognitive burden, it is critical to support automated service composition and make efficient recommendation of personalized services to achieve user's overall goals. However, existing approaches only offer users with limited options designed for the interest of a group of users without considering individual users' interests. To allow users to compose personalized services without much manual specification, we propose a machine learning approach that applies a learning-to-rank algorithm, RankBoost, to automatically learn user preferences and the prioritization of the preferences from users' historical data. Moreover, our approach uses the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm to make trade-offs among user preferences and recommends a collection of services to achieve the highest objective. We conduct an empirical study to evaluate our approach by collecting the historical data from 12 subjects. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the two well-established baseline approaches by 100%-200% in terms of precision on recommending services.","With the rapid growth of the web services technologies, users often leverage various web services to perform their daily activities, such as on-line shopping.

Since there is a large number of factors that need to be taken into consideration, the task is very challenging. In this paper, we present an approach that adapts to the most influential factors in a way that varies from one learner to another, and in different learning settings, including individual and collaborative learning. The approach utilizes reinforcement learning for building an intelligent environment that, not only provides a method for suggesting suitable learning materials, but also provides a methodology for accounting for the continuously-changing studentsâ states and acceptance of technology. We evaluate our system through simulations. The obtained results are promising and show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

4,0,0,0,0,Learning-based ship design optimization approach,"With the development of computer applications in ship design, optimization, as a powerful approach, has been widely used in the design and analysis process. However, the running time, which often varies from several weeks to months in the current computing environment, has been a bottleneck problem for optimization applications, particularly in the structural design of ships. To speed up the optimization process and adjust the complex design environment, ship designers usually rely on their personal experience to assist the design work. However, traditional experience, which largely depends on the designer's personal skills, often makes the design quality very sensitive to the experience and decreases the robustness of the final design. This paper proposes a new machine-learning-based ship design optimization approach, which uses machine learning as an effective tool to give direction to optimization and improves the adaptability of optimization to the dynamic design environment. The natural human learning process is introduced into the optimization procedure to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Q-learning, as an approach of reinforcement learning, is utilized to realize the learning function in the optimization process. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization method, multi-agent system, and CAE software are used to build an integrated optimization system. A bulk carrier structural design optimization was performed as a case study to evaluate the suitability of this method for real-world application. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The vision above requires the self-adaptation approach to tackle these challenges and some software systems have their own specific implementations. However, in this paper a general supporting framework is proposed for software systems to self-adapt with running environmental dynamics and meanwhile fulfill various user requirements. Three key issues are covered in the framework: 1) the overall control architecture, which adopts the double closed-loop style and respectively includes the self-adaptation loop and the self-learning loop; 2) a general descriptive language, which is a application-independent and unified language to represent self-adaptation knowledge about target systems; 3) three implementation mechanisms, including forward reasoning, planning and reinforcement learning using feedback, which are supported by the above descriptive language and executed at runtime in different modules. Finally, one scenario of on-demand services of massive data mining tasks is selected and the case study demonstrates how the framework is customized as required and how the approach works.","When confronted with their internal and environmental dynamics, various software systems increasingly require self-adaptation capabilities.

We use Reinforcement Learning methods for a wide spectrum of different database simulations, turn penalty conditions, and noise conditions. Our objective is to show that our policy learning framework covers this spectrum. We can show that even for challenging cases learning significantly outperforms hand-coded policies tailored to the different operating situations. The polices are adaptive/context-sensitive in respect of both the overall operating situation (e.g. noise) and the local context of the interaction (e.g. user's last move). The learned policies produce an average relative increase in reward of 25.7% over the corresponding threshold-based hand-coded baseline policies.","We show how to learn optimal dialogue policies for a wide range of database search applications, concerning how many database search results to present to the user, and when to present them.

10,2,1,2,2,"Probabilistic topic modeling, reinforcement learning, and crowdsourcing for personalized recommendations","We put forward an innovative use of probabilistic topic modeling (PTM) intertwined with reinforcement learning (RL), to provide personalized recommendations. Specifically, we model items under recommendation as mixtures of latent topics following a distribution with Dirichlet priors; this can be achieved via the exploitation of crowd-sourced information for each item. Similarly, we model the user herself as an âevolvingâ document represented by its respective mixture of latent topics. The userâs topic distribution is appropriately updated each time she consumes an item. Recommendations are subsequently based on the divergence between the topic distributions of the user and available items. However, to tackle the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, we apply RL to vary the userâs topic distribution update rate. Our method is immune to the notorious âcold startâ problem, and it can effectively cope with changing user preferences. Moreover, it is shown to be competitive against state-of-the-art algorithms, outperforming them in terms of sequential performance.

We detail two instantiations for regression and classification scenarios and obtain well-known algorithms for these special cases.

This system utilizes multiple advanced computational approaches including the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model for watershed simulations, interactive genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms for search and optimization, and deep learning artificial neural networks for user modeling, within an encompassing human-computer interaction framework. A substantial user study of the WRESTORE system was conducted recently involving multiple real stakeholders varying from consultants, government officials, watershed alliance members, etc., with the objective of gaining insight about WRESTORE'S usability and utility. In particular focus was the user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's preferences and criteria, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs (similar to the idea of user profiling commonly done for human-computer interaction systems). The user model constructed based on the real user's personalized feedbacks can then be used to influence the automated search and optimization for BMP alternatives in WRESTORE. In this paper, we describe the methods developed for user modeling for interactive optimization, and the experimental set-up as well as results with real user studies.

20,2,1,2,2,A scalable approach for periodical personalized recommendations,"We develop a highly scalable and effective contextual bandit approach towards periodical personalized recommendations. The online bootstrapping-based technique provides a princi- pled way for UCB-type exploitation-exploration algorithms, while being able to handle arbitrary sized datasets, well suited to learn the ever evolving user preference drift from streaming data, and essentially parameter-free.

21,2,2,0,2,"Towards efficient, personalized anesthesia using continuous reinforcement learning for propofol infusion control","We demonstrate the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for efficient and personalized control of patients' depth of general anesthesia during surgical procedures - an important aspect for Neurotechnology. We used the continuous actor-critic learning automaton technique, which was trained and tested in silico using published patient data, physiological simulation and the bispectral index (BIS) of patient EEG. Our two-stage technique learns first a generic effective control strategy based on average patient data (factory stage) and can then fine-tune itself to individual patients (personalization stage). The results showed that the reinforcement learner as compared to a bang-bang controller reduced the dose of the anesthetic agent administered by 9.4% and kept the patient closer to the target state, as measured by RMSE (4.90 compared to 8.47). It also kept the BIS error within a narrow, clinically acceptable range 93.9% of the time. Moreover, the policy was trained using only 50 simulated operations. Being able to learn a control strategy this quickly indicates that the reinforcement learner could also adapt regularly to a patient's changing responses throughout a live operation and facilitate the task of anesthesiologists by prompting them with recommended actions.","We demonstrate the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for efficient and personalized control of patients' depth of general anesthesia during surgical procedures - an important aspect for Neurotechnology.

22,0,0,0,0,Learning capabilities for improving automatic transmission control,"We analyzed the gear-box position selection (GPS) problem on automatic transmission (AT) and proposed an algorithm, based on learning control, to improve vehicle behavior and driver satisfaction. Our approach guarantees optimization of vehicle performance and adaptation to the driver's style with road condition sensitivity. This improvement has been achieved by combining three knowledge acquisition sources: embedded dynamic models of powertrain, inductive inspection of driver actions and AT designer expertise; and by adding learning capabilities in order to significantly increase the system autonomy. Technically, GPS raises the following four problems which this paper addresses: (1) To achieve vehicle performance optimization of multiple antagonistic criteria, locally and globally over time, we considered a parametric disciminant function depending on an evaluation of the driver satisfaction and so called driver-style-state functions, as a reward for the system, and applied a reinforcement learning algorithm, derived from Q-learning method and combined with a mechanism to escape local optima. (2) Learning directly from the driver is performed when he selects AT ratio in manual mode. (3) Each driver's personal style is represented by a Glass creation/selection mechanism. (4) GPS raises a few singularities which are addressed by a set of restriction rules derived from AT control expertise.","We analyzed the gear-box position selection (GPS) problem on automatic transmission (AT) and proposed an algorithm, based on learning control, to improve vehicle behavior and driver satisfaction.

23,1,0,1,1,Automatic ad format selection via contextual bandits,"Visual design plays an important role in online display advertising: changing the layout of an online ad can increase or decrease its effectiveness, measured in terms of click-through rate (CTR) or total revenue. The decision of which layout to use for an ad involves a trade-off: using a layout provides feedback about its effectiveness (exploration), but collecting that feedback requires sacrificing the immediate reward of using a layout we already know is effective (exploitation). To balance exploration with exploitation, we pose automatic layout selection as a contextual bandit problem. There are many bandit algorithms, each generating a policy which must be evaluated. It is impractical to test each policy on live traffic. However, we have found that offline replay (a.k.a. exploration scavenging) can be adapted to provide an accurate estimator for the performance of ad layout policies at Linkedin, using only historical data about the effectiveness of layouts. We describe the development of our offline replayer, and benchmark a number of common bandit algorithms.

However, there are opportunities to improve control performances by introducing more recent information and machine learning technologies which allow more comprehensive consideration of the balance between user comfort and system energy consumption. To be more specific, in terms of user comfort, unified set-point may not be desirable since different people may have different comfort preferences. In terms of energy consumption, the excessive cooling load of HVAC system should be considered in summer when utilizing solar incidence to reduce the lighting electricity consumption. The setting of the blind slat angle still has great room to improve instead of the cut-off angle. Moreover, users' demands are not fully met, so sometimes they still want to override the automated control. Thus, a closed-loop satisfaction based system is developed in this paper, specifically we introduce an improved reinforcement learning controller to obtain an optimal control strategy of blinds and lights. It could provide a personalized service via introducing subjects perceptions of surroundings gathered by a novel interface as the feedback signal.

However, there is no systematic way to integrate passengers' personal preferences in planning public transit routes and schedules so as to achieve high occupancy rates and efficiency gain of ride-sharing.

We propose a data-driven method to construct a Markov decision process model that characterizes the process of passengers making sequential public transit choices, in bus routes, subway lines, and transfer stops/stations. Using the model, we integrate softmax policy iteration into maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to infer the passenger's reward function from observed trajectory data. The inferred reward function will enable an urban planner to predict passengers' route planning decisions given some proposed transit plans, for example, opening a new bus route or subway line. Finally, we demonstrate the correctness and accuracy of our modeling and inference methods in a large-scale (three months) passenger-level public transit trajectory data from Shenzhen, China.

The results have highlighted that the knowledge derived from the learning information analysis proved to effective in generating personalized recommendation policies that can cater the context specific requirements of the learners.",,,,"SCSE, VIT University, Vellore, Tamilnadu, India",LO recommendation;MOOC;Reinforcement Learning;learning context;learning experience,Author2,Author3,a,a,a,a,a,a,Recommender Systems,a,,,a,a,"2014 IEEE International Conference on MOOC, Innovation and Technology in Education (MITE)",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020289,,V.

31,1,1,2,1,Reinforcement learning of context models for a ubiquitous personal assistant,"Ubiquitous environments may become a reality in a foreseeable future and research is aimed on making them more and more adapted and comfortable for users. Our work consists on applying reinforcement learning techniques in order to adapt services provided by a ubiquitous assistant to the user. The learning produces a context model, associating actions to perceived situations of the user. Associations are based on feedback given by the user as a reaction to the behavior of the assistant. Our method brings a solution to some of the problems encountered when applying reinforcement learning to systems where the user is in the loop. For instance, the behavior of the system is completely incoherent at the be-ginning and needs time to converge. The user does not accept to wait that long to train the system. The user's habits may change over time and the assistant needs to integrate these changes quickly. We study methods to accelerate the reinforced learning process.

32,2,2,0,2,Reinforcement learning strategies for clinical trials in nonsmall cell lung cancer,"Typical regimens for advanced metastatic stage IIIB/IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consist of multiple lines of treatment. We present an adaptive reinforcement learning approach to discover optimal individualized treatment regimens from a specially designed clinical trial (a ""clinical reinforcement trial"") of an experimental treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC who have not been treated previously with systemic therapy. In addition to the complexity of the problem of selecting optimal compounds for first- and second-line treatments based on prognostic factors, another primary goal is to determine the optimal time to initiate second-line therapy, either immediately or delayed after induction therapy, yielding the longest overall survival time. A reinforcement learning method calledQ-learning is utilized, which involves learning an optimal regimen from patient data generated from the clinical reinforcement trial. Approximating theQ-function with time-indexed parameters can be achieved by using a modification of support vector regression that can utilize censored data. Within this framework, a simulation study shows that the procedure can extract optimal regimens for two lines of treatment directly from clinical data without prior knowledge of the treatment effect mechanism. In addition, we demonstrate that the design reliably selects the best initial time for second-line therapy while taking into account the heterogeneity of NSCLC across patients.

Recent work has shown that transfer learning can be extended to the idea of curriculum learning, where the agent incrementally accumulates knowledge over a sequence of tasks (i.e. a curriculum). In most existing work, such curricula have been constructed manually. Furthermore, they are fixed ahead of time, and do not adapt to the progress or abilities of the agent. In this paper, we formulate the design of a curriculum as a Markov Decision Process, which directly models the accumulation of knowledge as an agent interacts with tasks, and propose a method that approximates an execution of an optimal policy in this MDP to produce an agent-specific curriculum. We use our approach to automatically sequence tasks for 3 agents with varying sensing and action capabilities in an experimental domain, and show that our method produces curricula customized for each agent that improve performance relative to learning from scratch or using a different agent's curriculum.","Transfer learning is a method where an agent reuses knowledge learned in a source task to improve learning on a target task.

35,2,2,2,2,Affective personalization of a social robot tutor for children's second language skills,"Though substantial research has been dedicated towards using technology to improve education, no current methods are as effective as one-on-one tutoring. A critical, though relatively understudied, aspect of effective tutoring is modulating the student's affective state throughout the tutoring session in order to maximize long-term learning gains. We developed an integrated experimental paradigm in which children play a second-language learning game on a tablet, in collaboration with a fully autonomous social robotic learning companion. As part of the system, we measured children's valence and engagement via an automatic facial expression analysis system. These signals were combined into a reward signal that fed into the robot's affective reinforcement learning algorithm. Over several sessions, the robot played the game and personalized its motivational strategies (using verbal and non-verbal actions) to each student. We evaluated this system with 34 children in preschool classrooms for a duration of two months. We saw that (1) children learned new words from the repeated tutoring sessions, (2) the affective policy personalized to students over the duration of the study, and (3) students who interacted with a robot that personalized its affective feedback strategy showed a significant increase in valence, as compared to students who interacted with a nonpersonalizing robot. This integrated system of tablet-based educational content, affective sensing, affective policy learning, and an autonomous social robot holds great promise for a more comprehensive approach to personalized tutoring.

Such goal-oriented dialogue agents typically need to interact with an external database to access real-world knowledge. Previous systems achieved this by issuing a symbolic query to the KB to retrieve entries based on their attributes. However, such symbolic operations break the differentiability of the system and prevent end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents. In this paper, we address this limitation by replacing symbolic queries with an induced ""soft"" posterior distribution over the KB that indicates which entities the user is interested in. Integrating the soft retrieval process with a reinforcement learner leads to higher task success rate and reward in both simulations and against real users.

38,2,0,0,0,Multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm and its improved convergency method,"This paper proposes a multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm (MORLA) and uses simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) to improve the convergence of it. Usually, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to design neurocontroller for control system with single objective. When facing multi-objective system, it is necessary to design the neurocontroller according to the personal preference. The MORLA can transform the multi-objective into synthetical objective and applies parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) to evolve the neurocontroller according to the synthetical objective. To establish the synthetical objective, the objective weight which represents the personal preference is calculated by solving the constrained optimization problem (COP) at the end of each generation. The COP requires not only the biggest variance of the synthetical objective in the population, but also requires the weight to fit the designer's preference. After acquiring the weights, the PGA can select the elitists from the population according to the designer's preference and design a satisfying neurocontroller by evolutionary operations. In addition, although GA has good global search ability, it descends slowly at local area. This paper applies SPSA algorithm to search optimal solution when GA is vibrating at local area. The SPSA converges fast by efficient gradient approximation that relies on measurements of the objective function. The hybrid algorithm accelerates the learning speed of reinforcement learning. At last, the MORLA is used to design neurocontroller for a speed-controlled induction motor drive with indirect vector control.

39,2,2,0,2,A reinforcement learning approach for individualizing erythropoietin dosages in hemodialysis patients,"This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for anemia management in patients undergoing chronic renal failure. Erythropoietin (EPO) is the treatment of choice for this kind of anemia but it is an expensive drug and with some dangerous side-effects that should be considered especially for patients who do not respond to the treatment. Therefore, an individualized treatment appears to be necessary. RL is a suitable approach to tackle this problem. Moreover, resulting policies are similar to medical protocols, and hence, they can easily be transferred to daily practice. A cohort of 64 patients are included in the study. An implementation of the Q-learning algorithm based on a state-aggregation table and another implementation using the multi-layer perceptron as a function approximator (Q-MLP) are compared with the protocols followed in the Nephrology Unit. The policy obtained by the Q-MLP approach outperforms the hospital policy in terms of the ratio of patients that are within the targeted range of hemoglobin (11.5-12.5 g/dl) at the end of the analyzed period, since an increase of 25% is observed. It ensures an improvement in patients' quality-of-life and considerable economic savings for the health care system due to both the expensiveness of EPO treatment and the costs incurred by the health care system in order to alleviate problems related to EPO over-dosing. It should be pointed out that the approach presented here is completely general, and therefore, it can be applied to any problem of drug dosage optimization. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40,0,0,0,0,Angle of arrival estimation in dynamic indoor THz channels with Bayesian filter and reinforcement learning,"This paper presents a novel algorithm to estimate the Angle of Arrival (AoA) in a dynamic indoor Terahertz channel. In a realistic application, the user equipment is often moved by the user during the data transmission and the AoA must be estimated periodically, such that the adaptive directional antenna can be adjusted to realize a high antenna gain. The Bayesian filter is applied to exploit continuity and smoothness of the channel dynamics for the AoA estimation. Reinforcement learning is introduced to adapt the prior transition probabilities between system states, in order to fit the variation of application scenarios and personal habits. The algorithm is validated using the ray launching channel simulator and realistic human movement models.","This paper presents a novel algorithm to estimate the Angle of Arrival (AoA) in a dynamic indoor Terahertz channel.

Under the framework of the proposed model, reinforcement learning is used to capture the human-desired driving strategy, and the proportion-integration-differentiation controller is adopted to convert the learning strategy to low-level control commands. The performance of the learning model is tested in the simulation environment built in a driving simulator using PreScan.

Moreover, compared with the traditional adaptive cruise control, the proposed model can provide better driving comfort and smoothness in the dynamic situation.","This paper develops a learning model for personalized adaptive cruise control that can learn from human demonstration online and mimic a human driver's driving strategies in the dynamic traffic environment.

When applied in the context of treatment design, this method provides the means to evaluate both the therapeutic and diagnostic effects of treatments in constructing an adaptive treatment strategy. The methodology is illustrated with data from the STAR*D trial, a multi-step randomized study of treatment alternatives for individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.

43,0,0,1,0,Smart Cable-Driven Camera Robotic Assistant,"This paper describes the mechanical design and a cognition system for a novel concept-of-camera robotic assistant. The system combines the advantages of intra-abdominal devices and autonomous camera navigation. The robotic assistant is composed of a magnetic intra-abdominal camera robot with two internal cable-driven degrees of freedom and an external robot that handles an external magnet. The intelligence of the robot is implemented in a cognitive architecture based on a long-term memory that stores the robot's knowledge and learning capabilities to improve the robot's behavior. The navigation strategy combines a reactive control based on instrument tracking and a proactive control based on predefined behaviors, depending on the actual state of the task. The robot's learning capabilities include a semantic customization, to adapt the camera's behavior to the surgeon's preferences, and reinforcement learning, to improve the camera navigation strategy. This paper details both the hardware implementation of the system and the software implementation in a robotic operating system architecture. The cognition system and the performance of the cable-driven mechanism have been validated with a set of in vitro experiments. Moreover, the camera robot has been evaluated through an in-vivo experiment in a pig.","This paper describes the mechanical design and a cognition system for a novel concept-of-camera robotic assistant.

It is recognized that quite often users need some personalized adaptations to access Web contents. This is more evident when we focus on people with some accessibility needs.

48,0,0,0,0,The route not taken: Driver-centric estimation of electric vehicle range,"This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently and accurately predicting an electric vehicle's attainable range. Specifically, our approach accounts for a driver's generalised route preferences to provide up-to-date, personalised information based on estimates of the energy required to reach every possible destination in a map. We frame this task in the context of sequential decision making and show that energy consumption in reaching a particular destination can be formulated as policy evaluation in a Markov Decision Process. In particular, we exploit the properties of the model adopted for predicting likely energy consumption to every possible destination in a realistically sized map in real-time. The policy to be evaluated is learned and, over time, refined using Inverse Reinforcement Learning to provide for a life-long adaptive system. Our approach is evaluated using a publicly available dataset providing real trajectory data of 50 individuals spanning approximately 10,000 miles of travel. We show that by accounting for driver specific route preferences our system significantly reduces the relative error in energy prediction compared to more common, driver-agnostic heuristics such as shortest-path or shortest-time routes.

In this chapter, the author focuses on the challenge of personalized anemia treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin. The author demonstrates the application of a standard reinforcement learning method, called Q-learning, to guide the physician in selecting the optimal erythropoietin dose. The author further addresses the issue of random exploration in Q-learning from the drug dosing perspective and proposes a ""smart"" exploration method. Finally, the author performs computer simulations to compare the outcomes from reinforcement learning-based anemia treatment to those achieved by a standard dosing protocol used at a dialysis unit.

This paper focuses on a different scenario: the user is supposed to be able to access content from multiple providers, in our application they offer radio channels, and it is up to a personal recommender installed on the clients' side to decide which channel to select and recommend to the user. We exploit the implicit feedback derived from the user's listening behavior, and we model channel recommendation as a sequential decision making problem.

54,1,0,0,0,GongBroker: A Broker Model for Power Trading in Smart Grid Markets,"The Smart Grid market is dynamic and complex, and brokers are widely introduced to better manage this market. This paper proposes an intelligent broker model - GongBroker, with smart trading strategies to cope with the dynamics and complexity. GongBroker first predicts the short-term demands of various consumers, and then buys energy from the wholesale market through auctions, and sells energy to various consumers in the retail market. In order to predict the customer demand, a data-driven method is proposed. All the consumers are hierarchically clustered according to their historical energy consumptions, and different prediction methods are tailored for different customer clusters to predict one-day-ahead hourly energy demand. Based on the predicted demand, the GongBroker employs a Markov Decision Process for the one-day-ahead auction in the wholesale market. To compete with other brokers, GongBroker uses independent reinforcement learning processes to optimize prices for different types of consumers. Experimental results demonstrate that GongBroker not only is competitive in making profit, but also keeps a good supply-demand balance.","The Smart Grid market is dynamic and complex, and brokers are widely introduced to better manage this market.

58,2,2,0,2,Active learning for personalizing treatment,"The personalization of treatment via genetic biomarkers and other risk categories has drawn increasing interest among clinical researchers and scientists. A major challenge here is to construct individualized treatment rules (ITR), which recommend the best treatment for each of the different categories of individuals. In general, ITRs can be constructed using data from clinical trials, however these are generally very costly to run. In order to reduce the cost of learning an ITR, we explore active learning techniques designed to carefully decide whom to recruit, and which treatment to assign, throughout the online conduct of the clinical trial. As an initial investigation, we focus on simple ITRs that utilize a small number of subpopulation categories to personalize treatment. To minimize the maximal uncertainty regarding the treatment effects for each subpopulation, we propose the use of a minimax bandit model and provide an active learning policy for solving it. We evaluate our active learning policy using simulated data and data modeled after a clinical trial involving treatments for depressed individuals. We contrast this policy with other plausible active learning policies. The techniques presented in the paper may be generalized to tackle problems of efficient exploration in other domains.","The personalization of treatment via genetic biomarkers and other risk categories has drawn increasing interest among clinical researchers and scientists.

In the algorithm proposed in this paper, we have considered evacuees under two groups, based on their age and physical condition, and we tailor two routing metrics, one for each group, in finding suitable paths for the evacuees. A dynamic grouping mechanism that can adjust an evacuee's group, and therefore routing metric, according to its on-going health condition is employed during the evacuation. To implement the routing metrics, we have used the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) with random neural networks (RNN) and reinforcement learning. The CPN is an adaptive routing protocol that is loop-free at all times and easily handles multiple quality of service (QoS) metrics. Simulation results show that allowing the navigation system to be sensitive to the on-going health conditions and mobility of the evacuees, using our proposed dynamic grouping, can achieve higher survival rates.","The performance of Emergency Management Systems (EMS) in confined spaces is highly dependent on the decision algorithm employed for the safe navigation of the evacuees to the available exits.

To implement the routing metrics, we have used the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) with random neural networks (RNN) and reinforcement learning. The CPN is an adaptive routing protocol that is loop-free at all times and easily handles multiple quality of service (QoS) metrics. Simulation results show that allowing the navigation system to be sensitive to the on-going health conditions and mobility of the evacuees, using our proposed dynamic grouping, can achieve higher survival rates.",,,,"Dept. of Electr. & Electron.

65,2,2,0,2,A reinforcement learning approach to weaning of mechanical ventilation in intensive care units,"The management of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the regulation of sedation and analgesia during ventilation, constitutes a major part of the care of patients admitted to intensive care units. Both prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation and premature extubation are associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs, but clinical opinion on the best protocol for weaning patients off of a ventilator varies. This work aims to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information to predict time-to-extubation readiness and to recommend a personalized regime of sedation dosage and ventilator support. To this end, we use off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms to determine the best action at a given patient state from sub-optimal historical ICU data. We compare treatment policies from fitted Qiteration with extremely randomized trees and with feedforward neural networks, and demonstrate that the policies learnt show promise in recommending weaning protocols with improved outcomes, in terms of minimizing rates of reintubation and regulating physiological stability.","The management of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the regulation of sedation and analgesia during ventilation, constitutes a major part of the care of patients admitted to intensive care units.

Homoeostasis is partially regulated through the expression of core protein groups whose functionality is determined at gene level and modulated by environmental factors. Harmful changes in physiology may promote several dis-functionalities. In prior work gene expression was used as a biomarker to assess both pathological propensity and disease progression. A growing body of pharmacogenomics research has developed new compounds, on one hand, and on the other, it has proposed novel therapeutic applications for the existing ones. Over the past decades, collective efforts have significantly increased the number of omics information available. However, efficient and deterministic in silico mechanisms that efficiently analyse and detect trends on the basis of often unknown and limited physiological information responding to challenging clinical questions are still lacking. In this context, computational automation via artificial intelligence methodologies has proven to be accurate, robust to noise, cost efficient, and dynamic dealing with massive databases and forecasting on the basis of the available information. Moreover, this set of computational techniques, based on well-established mathematical models, provide efficient ways of determining trends based on both a priori knowledge and dynamically acquired information, working successfully on incomplete datasets. Therefore, in this chapter we assess developmental similarities between two major causes of worldwide death: glioblastoma and chronic arterial inflammation; and discuss the potential applicability of two artificial intelligence approaches for drug discovery and repositioning. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) a glioblastoma multiform is the most malignant glial-type tumour (graded level IV in the WHO scale); and inflammatory diseases affecting the cardiovascular network are the cause of high mortality. As suggested, these two pathologies have several developmental similarities and share common genetic variants.

We introduce a novel paging scheme based on the concept of reinforcement learning. Learning endows the paging mechanism with the predictive power necessary to determine a mobile terminal's position, without having to extract a location probability distribution for each specific user. The proposed algorithm is compared against a heuristic randomized learning strategy akin to reinforcement learning, that we invented for this purpose and performs better than the case where no learning is used at all.

69,2,2,0,2,On-line policy learning and adaptation for real-time personalization of an artificial pancreas,"The dynamic complexity of the glucose-insulin metabolism in diabetic patients is the main obstacle towards widespread use of an artificial pancreas. The significant level of subject-specific glycemic variability requires continuously adapting the control policy to successfully face daily changes in patient's metabolism and lifestyle. In this paper, an on-line selective reinforcement learning algorithm that enables real-time adaptation of a control policy based on ongoing interactions with the patient so as to tailor the artificial pancreas is proposed. Adaptation includes two online procedures: on-line sparsification and parameter updating of the Gaussian process used to approximate the control policy. With the proposed sparsification method, the support data dictionary for on-line learning is modified by checking if in the arriving data stream there exists novel information to be added to the dictionary in order to personalize the policy. Results obtained in silico experiments demonstrate that on-line policy learning is both safe and efficient for maintaining blood glucose variability within the normoglycemic range.

However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. The ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.

72,1,0,2,1,Learning conversational systems that interleave task and non-task content,"Task-oriented dialog systems have been applied in various tasks, such as automated personal assistants, customer service providers and tutors. These systems work well when users have clear and explicit intentions that are well-aligned to the systems' capabilities. However, they fail if users intentions are not explicit. To address this shortcoming, we propose a framework to interleave nontask content (i.e. everyday social conversation) into task conversations. When the task content fails, the system can still keep the user engaged with the non-task content. We trained a policy using reinforcement learning algorithms to promote long-turn conversation coherence and consistency, so that the system can have smooth transitions between task and non-task content. To test the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we developed a movie promotion dialog system. Experiments with human users indicate that a system that interleaves social and task content achieves a better task success rate and is also rated as more engaging compared to a pure task-oriented system.","Task-oriented dialog systems have been applied in various tasks, such as automated personal assistants, customer service providers and tutors.

73,1,1,1,1,Closed-loop task difficulty adaptation during virtual reality reach-to-grasp training assisted with an exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation,"Stroke patients with severe motor deficits of the upper extremity may practice rehabilitation exercises with the assistance of a multi-joint exoskeleton. Although this technology enables intensive task-oriented training, it may also lead to slacking when the assistance is too supportive. Preserving the engagement of the patients while providing ""assistance-as-needed"" during the exercises, therefore remains an ongoing challenge. We applied a commercially available seven degree-of-freedom arm exoskeleton to provide passive gravity compensation during task-oriented training in a virtual environment. During this 4-week pilot study, five severely affected chronic stroke patients performed reach-to-grasp exercises resembling activities of daily living. The subjects received virtual reality feedback from their three-dimensional movements. The level of difficulty for the exercise was adjusted by a performance-dependent real-time adaptation algorithm. The goal of this algorithm was the automated improvement of the range of motion. In the course of 20 training and feedback sessions, this unsupervised adaptive training concept led to a progressive increase of the virtual training space (p < 0.001) in accordance with the subjects' abilities. This learning curve was paralleled by a concurrent improvement of real world kinematic parameters, i.e., range of motion (p = 0.008), accuracy of movement (p = 0.01), and movement velocity (p < 0.001). Notably, these kinematic gains were paralleled by motor improvements such as increased elbow movement (p = 0.001), grip force (p < 0.001), and upper extremity Fugl-Meyer-Assessment score from 14.3 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 5 to 16.9 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 6.1 (p = 0.026). Combining gravity-compensating assistance with adaptive closed-loop feedback in virtual reality provides customized rehabilitation environments for severely affected stroke patients. This approach may facilitate motor learning by progressively challenging the subject in accordance with the individual capacity for functional restoration. It might be necessary to apply concurrent restorative interventions to translate these improvements into relevant functional gains of severely motor impaired patients in activities of daily living.

Quite recently, conversational approaches have been introduced in order to support more interactive recommendation sessions.

In this paper, we present a new type of recommender system which is capable of learning autonomously an adaptive interaction strategy for assisting the users in acquiring their interaction goals. We view the recommendation process as a sequential decision problem and we model it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We learn a model of the user behavior, and use it to acquire the adaptive strategy using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. In this context, the system learns the optimal strategy by observing the consequences of its actions on the users and also on the final outcome of the recommendation session.

82,2,1,1,1,A design proposal of a game-based professional training system for highly dangerous professions,"Recently, modern society frequently faces local wars, terrorism, earthquakes, fire accidents, epidemics and coal mining accidents. Members of highly dangerous professions must obtain rigorous training so that they could bear the great historical mission. Generally speaking, these professions include armed forces, special police force, fire department, astronauts and mine disaster rescue troop. The game-based professional training systems for highly dangerous professions have their own distinct requirements. The aim of game-based learning systems is not only the study of declarative knowledge, but also entraining procedural knowledge through repeated practice until it becomes an automatic skill. The result of highly dangerous professional training is extremely important, since if a trainee dose not master the basic knowledge and skill, they could be in grave danger; the trainee's mental qualities should be continuously prompted by the training system so that they could be act intuitively under the most execrable circumstance. Based on requirements analysis and taking the case of mining rescue into account, we divide the whole training system into three parts: machine learning subsystem, brain information subsystem and credit-assignment subsystem. The machine learning subsystem (as know as serious game subsystem), contains the audio-visual coherency analysis, semantic annotation of a scene based on association memory, cooperating management of audio-visual cross-modal signals, personalization rendering of a scene. The brain information subsystem includes functions for receiving, storing and analyzing trainee's trial data based on visual and auditory signals from EEG, sEMG and psychological tests. The credit-assignment subsystem involves trainee's profiles and effect evaluation which are sent from brain information subsystem to machine learning subsystem, while the plan of knowledge learning, the result of skills training and consequence of the desensitization trial are sent as the feedback to brain information subsystem. Therefore, the whole framework works as a reinforcement learning system. The kernel of this system is the cooperating learning schema of audio-visual cross-modal signals. Furthermore, in this system the main visual signals contain scene textures, 3D character animation, 3D scene animation, while the main auditory signals contain the realistic sound, the on-the-spot orders, the on-the-spot yells and background music. In the light of cognitive principles, the following factors should be considered when a game-based leaning system is designed: (1)The working memory including phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad act as two slave systems, play the role of dual sensory channels so that semantic coherency of the visual and the auditory data could be combined with the prior knowledge to be formed as long-term memory; (2) A goal of cooperative learning for audio-visual cross-modal signals is to create an approach which can process verbal information(like the realistic sound and the on-the-spot orders) and non-verbal information(such as 3D character animation as well as 3D scene animation) from the two separate subsystems; (3) Schema acquisition (based on Theory of Cognitive Load -TCL) should be a primary means of learning, and the automation of cognitive process (including declarative knowledge procedural knowledge) will be used to reduce working memory load.","Recently, modern society frequently faces local wars, terrorism, earthquakes, fire accidents, epidemics and coal mining accidents.

83,0,0,1,0,Decomposing drama management in educational interactive narrative: A modular reinforcement learning approach,"Recent years have seen growing interest in data-driven approaches to personalized interactive narrative generation and drama management. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows particular promise for training policies to dynamically shape interactive narratives based on corpora of player-interaction data. An important open question is how to design reinforcement learning-based drama managers in order to make effective use of player interaction data, which is often expensive to gather and sparse relative to the vast state and action spaces required by drama management. We investigate an offline optimization framework for training modular reinforcement learning-based drama managers in an educational interactive narrative, CRYSTAL ISLAND. We leverage importance sampling to evaluate drama manager policies derived from different decompositional representations of the interactive narrative. Empirical results show significant improvements in drama manager quality from adopting an optimized modular RL decomposition compared to competing representations.

The objective of our work is to develop an intelligent socially assistive robot that can engage individuals in person-centered cognitively stimulating activities. In this paper, we present the design of a novel learning-based control architecture that enables the robot to act as a social motivator by providing assistance, encouragement and celebration during the course of an activity. A hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approach is used to provide the robot with the ability to: (i) learn appropriate assistive behaviors based on the structure of the activity and (ii) personalize the interaction based on the person's affective state during the activity. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed learning-based control architecture is effective in determining the optimal assistive behaviors of the robot during a memory game interaction.","Recent studies have shown that sustained engagement in cognitively stimulating activities has had positive effects on the cognitive functioning of humans.

85,0,0,0,0,A personalized QoE-aware handover decision based on distributed reinforcement learning,"Recent developments in heterogeneous mobile networks and growing demands for variety of real-time and multimedia applications have emphasized the necessity of more intelligent handover decisions. Addressing the context knowledge of mobile devices, users, applications, and networks is the subject of context-aware handoff decision as a recent effort to this aim. However, user perception has not been attended adequately in the area of context-aware handover decision making. Mobile users may have different judgments about the Quality of Service (QoS) depending on their environmental conditions, and personal and psychological characteristics. This reality has been exploited in this paper to introduce a personalized user-centric handoff decision method to decide about the time and target of handover based on User Perceived Quality (UPQ) feedbacks. The UPQ degradations are mainly for the sake of (1) exiting the coverage of the serving Point of Attachment (PoA) or (2) QoS degradation of serving access network. Using UPQ metric, the proposed method obviates the necessity of being aware about rapidly varying network QoS parameters and overcomes the complexity and overhead of gathering and managing some other context information. Moreover, considering the underlying network and geographical map, the proposed method is able to inherently exploit the trajectory information of mobile users for handover decision. UPQ degradation is not only due to the user behaviour, but also due to the behaviours of others users. As such, multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm has been considered for target PoA selection. The employed decision algorithm is based on WoLF-PHC learning method where UPQ is used as a delayed reward for training. The proposed handoff decision has been implemented under IEEE 802.21 framework using NS2 network simulator. The results have shown better performance of the proposed method comparing to conventional methods assuming regular movement of mobile users.

The method can be applied to sequential multipleassignment randomized trials to develop personalized adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs)-longitudinal practice guidelines highly tailored to time-varying attributes of individual patients. Sometimes, the basis for choosing which ATSs to include in a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (or randomized controlled trial) may be inadequate. Nonrandomized data sources may inform the initial design of ATSs, which could later be prospectively validated. In this paper, we illustrate challenges involved in using nonrandomized data for this purpose with a case study from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry (1995-2007) aimed at 1) determining whether the sequence of therapeutic classes used in graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis and in refractory graft-versus-host disease is associated with improved survival and 2) identifying donor and patient factors with which to guide individualized immunosuppressant selections over time. We discuss how to communicate the potential benefit derived from following an ATS at the population and subgroup levels and how to evaluate its robustness to modeling assumptions.

89,2,2,0,2,Deep reinforcement learning for automated radiation adaptation in lung cancer:,"Purpose: To investigate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based on historical treatment plans for developing automated radiation adaptation protocols for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that aim to maximize tumor local control at reduced rates of radiation pneumonitis grade 2 (RP2). Methods: In a retrospective population of 114 NSCLC patients who received radiotherapy, a three-component neural networks framework was developed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of dose fractionation adaptation. Large-scale patient characteristics included clinical, genetic, and imaging radiomics features in addition to tumor and lung dosimetric variables. First, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to learn patient population characteristics necessary for DRL training from a relatively limited sample size. Second, a radiotherapy artificial environment (RAE) was reconstructed by a deep neural network (DNN) utilizing both original and synthetic data (by GAN) to estimate the transition probabilities for adaptation of personalized radiotherapy patients' treatment courses. Third, a deep Q-network (DQN) was applied to the RAE for choosing the optimal dose in a response-adapted treatment setting. This multicomponent reinforcement learning approach was benchmarked against real clinical decisions that were applied in an adaptive dose escalation clinical protocol. In which, 34 patients were treated based on avid PET signal in the tumor and constrained by a 17.2% normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) limit for RP2. The uncomplicated cure probability (P+) was used as a baseline reward function in the DRL. Results: Taking our adaptive dose escalation protocol as a blueprint for the proposed DRL (GAN + RAE + DQN) architecture, we obtained an automated dose adaptation estimate for use at â¼2/3 of the way into the radiotherapy treatment course. By letting the DQN component freely control the estimated adaptive dose per fraction (ranging from 1-5 Gy), the DRL automatically favored dose escalation/de-escalation between 1.5 and 3.8 Gy, a range similar to that used in the clinical protocol. The same DQN yielded two patterns of dose escalation for the 34 test patients, but with different reward variants. First, using the baseline P+ reward function, individual adaptive fraction doses of the DQN had similar tendencies to the clinical data with an RMSE = 0.76 Gy; but adaptations suggested by the DQN were generally lower in magnitude (less aggressive). Second, by adjusting the P+ reward function with higher emphasis on mitigating local failure, better matching of doses between the DQN and the clinical protocol was achieved with an RMSE = 0.5 Gy. Moreover, the decisions selected by the DQN seemed to have better concordance with patients eventual outcomes. In comparison, the traditional temporal difference (TD) algorithm for reinforcement learning yielded an RMSE = 3.3 Gy due to numerical instabilities and lack of sufficient learning. Conclusion: We demonstrated that automated dose adaptation by DRL is a feasible and a promising approach for achieving similar results to those chosen by clinicians. The process may require customization of the reward function if individual cases were to be considered. However, development of this framework into a fully credible autonomous system for clinical decision support would require further validation on larger multi-institutional datasets.

The proliferation of individually developed smart devices in the name of Internet of Things opens up a possibility of providing personalized services to a user in an autonomous and distributed manner. As a user's task often involves services supported by multiple devices, capturing a device-specific service preference is not enough to maximize a user's comfort. In this paper, we propose a distributed learning scheme for capturing multiple device service preferences in a smart environment. We exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method where each smart device acts as a reinforcement learning agent to incrementally and cooperatively capture a user specific preference of a task. Experiments confirm that smart devices with the proposed scheme are able to capture multiple device service preferences from a small number of interactions with a user and an environment. Also, the proposed transfer learning method improves learning performance for a new task.","Providing a personalized service to a user in a smart environment has been one of the key goals in the area of pervasive computing.

91,0,1,0,0,Learning from demonstration: Teaching a myoelectric prosthesis with an intact limb via reinforcement learning,"Prosthetic arms should restore and extend the capabilities of someone with an amputation. They should move naturally and be able to perform elegant, coordinated movements that approximate those of a biological arm. Despite these objectives, the control of modern-day prostheses is often nonintuitive and taxing. Existing devices and control approaches do not yet give users the ability to effect highly synergistic movements during their daily-life control of a prosthetic device. As a step towards improving the control of prosthetic arms and hands, we introduce an intuitive approach to training a prosthetic control system that helps a user achieve hard-to-engineer control behaviours. Specifically, we present an actor-critic reinforcement learning method that for the first time promises to allow someone with an amputation to use their non-amputated arm to teach their prosthetic arm how to move through a wide range of coordinated motions and grasp patterns. We evaluate our method during the myoelectric control of a multi-joint robot arm by non-amputee users, and demonstrate that by using our approach a user can train their arm to perform simultaneous gestures and movements in all three degrees of freedom in the robot's hand and wrist based only on information sampled from the robot and the user's above-elbow myoelectric signals. Our results indicate that this learning-from-demonstration paradigm may be well suited to use by both patients and clinicians with minimal technical knowledge, as it allows a user to personalize the control of his or her prosthesis without having to know the underlying mechanics of the prosthetic limb. These preliminary results also suggest that our approach may extend in a straightforward way to next-generation prostheses with precise finger and wrist control, such that these devices may someday allow users to perform fluid and intuitive movements like playing the piano, catching a ball, and comfortably shaking hands.","Prosthetic arms should restore and extend the capabilities of someone with an amputation.

93,1,0,0,0,Vito â a generic agent for multi-physics model personalization: Application to heart modeling,"Precise estimation of computational physiological model parameters from patient data is one of the main hurdles towards their clinical applicability. Designing robust estimation algorithms is often a tedious and model-specific process. We propose to use, for the first time to our knowledge, artificial intelligence (AI) concepts to learn how to personalize a computational model, inspired by how an expert manually personalizes. We reformulate the parameter estimation problem in terms of Markov decision process and reinforcement learning. In an off-line phase, the artificial agent, called Vito, automatically learns a representative state-action-state model through data-driven exploration of the computational model under consideration. In other words, Vito learns how the model behaves under change of parameters and how to personalize it. Vito then controls the on-line personalization by exploiting its automatically derived action policy. Because the algorithm is model-independent, personalizing a completely new model would require only adjusting some simple parameters of the agent and defining the observations to match, without the full knowledge of the model itself. Vito was evaluated on two challenging problems: the inverse problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the personalization of a lumped-parameter whole-body circulation model. Obtained results suggested that Vito could achieve equivalent goodness of fit than standard methods, while being more robust (up to 25% higher success rates) and with faster (up to three times) convergence rate. Our AI approach could thus make model personalization algorithms generalizable and self-adaptable to any patient, like a human operator.

95,1,0,2,1,A contextual-bandit approach to personalized news article recommendation,"Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc.) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory.

Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events.

Â© 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).","Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc.) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory.

96,1,0,2,1,Latent contextual bandits and their application to personalized recommendations for new users,"Personalized recommendations for new users, also known as the cold-start problem, can be formulated as a contextual bandit problem. Existing contextual bandit algorithms generally rely on features alone to capture user variability. Such methods are inefficient in learning new users' interests. In this paper we propose Latent Contextual Bandits. We consider both the benefit of leveraging a set of learned latent user classes for new users, and how we can learn such latent classes from prior users. We show that our approach achieves a better regret bound than existing algorithms. We also demonstrate the benefit of our approach using a large real world dataset and a preliminary user study.","Personalized recommendations for new users, also known as the cold-start problem, can be formulated as a contextual bandit problem.

97,1,0,2,1,Personalized recommendation via parameter-free contextual bandits,"Personalized recommendation services have gained increasing popularity and attention in recent years as most useful information can be accessed online in real-time. Most online recommender systems try to address the information needs of users by virtue of both user and content information. Despite extensive recent advances, the problem of personalized recommendation remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, the user and item repositories undergo frequent changes, which makes traditional recommendation algorithms ineffective. Second, the so-called cold-start problem is difficult to address, as the information for learning a recommendation model is limited for new items or new users. Both challenges are formed by the dilemma of exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we formulate personalized recommendation as a contextual bandit problem to solve the exploration/exploitation dilemma. Specifically in our work, we propose a parameter-free bandit strategy, which employs a principled resampling approach called online bootstrap, to derive the distribution of estimated models in an online manner. Under the paradigm of probability matching, the proposed algorithm randomly samples a model from the derived distribution for every recommendation. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world collections of web data (including online advertising and news recommendation) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the click-through rate. The experimental results also show that this proposed algorithm is robust in the cold-start situation, in which there is no sufficient data or knowledge to tune the parameters.

99,0,0,0,0,A self-taught artificial agent for multi-physics computational model personalization,"Personalization is the process of fitting a model to patient data, a critical step towards application of multi-physics computational models in clinical practice. Designing robust personalization algorithms is often a tedious, time-consuming, model- and data-specific process. We propose to use artificial intelligence concepts to learn this task, inspired by how human experts manually perform it. The problem is reformulated in terms of reinforcement learning. In an off-line phase, Vito, our self-taught artificial agent, learns a representative decision process model through exploration of the computational model: it learns how the model behaves under change of parameters. The agent then automatically learns an optimal strategy for on-line personalization. The algorithm is model-independent; applying it to a new model requires only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the observations to match. The full knowledge of the model itself is not required. Vito was tested in a synthetic scenario, showing that it could learn how to optimize cost functions generically. Then Vito was applied to the inverse problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the personalization of a whole-body circulation model. The obtained results suggested that Vito could achieve equivalent, if not better goodness of fit than standard methods, while being more robust (up to 11% higher success rates) and with faster (up to seven times) convergence rate. Our artificial intelligence approach could thus make personalization algorithms generalizable and self-adaptable to any patient and any model.

102,1,0,1,1,High-order feature-based mixture models of classification learning predict individual learning curves and enable personalized teaching,"Pattern classification learning tasks are commonly used to explore learning strategies in human subjects. The universal and individual traits of learning such tasks reflect our cognitive abilities and have been of interest both psychophysically and clinically. From a computational perspective, these tasks are hard, because the number of patterns and rules one could consider even in simple cases is exponentially large. Thus, when we learn to classify we must use simplifying assumptions and generalize. Studies of human behavior in probabilistic learning tasks have focused on rules in which pattern cues are independent, and also described individual behavior in terms of simple, single-cue, feature-based models. Here, we conducted psychophysical experiments in which people learned to classify binary sequences according to deterministic rules of different complexity, including high-order, multicue-dependent rules. We show that human performance on such tasks is very diverse, but that a class of reinforcement learning-like models that use a mixture of features captures individual learning behavior surprisinglywell. Thesemodels reflect the important role of subjects' priors, and their reliance on high-order features even when learning a low-order rule. Further, we show that these models predict future individual answers to a high degree of accuracy. We then use these models to build personally optimized teaching sessions and boost learning.","Pattern classification learning tasks are commonly used to explore learning strategies in human subjects.

103,2,1,1,1,Using Options to Accelerate Learning of New Tasks According to Human Preferences,"Over the years, people need to incorporate a wider range of information and multiple objectives for their decision making. Nowadays, humans are dependent on computer systems to interpret and take profit from the huge amount of available data on the Internet. Hence, varied services, such as location- based systems, must combine a huge quantity of raw data to give the desired response to the user. However, as humans have different preferences, the optimal answer is different for each user profile, and few systems offer the service of solving tasks in a customized manner for each user. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been used to autonomously train systems to solve (or assist on) decision-making tasks according to user preferences. However, the learning process is very slow and require many interactions with the environment. Therefore, we here propose to reuse knowledge from previous tasks to accelerate the learning process in a new task. Our proposal, called Multiobjective Options, accelerates learning while providing a customized solution according to the current user preferences. Our experiments in the Tourist World Domain show that our proposal learns faster and better than regular learning, and that the achieved solutions follow user preferences.

The goal of this paper is to further improve the response generation, using personalization criteria. We propose a novel method called PRGDDA (Personalized Response Generation by Dual-learning based Domain Adaptation) which is a personalized response generation model based on theories of domain adaptation and dual learning. During the training procedure, PRGDDA first learns the human responding style from large general data (without user-specific information), and then fine-tunes the model on a small size of personalized data to generate personalized conversations with a dual learning mechanism.

106,2,0,1,1,Trust and privacy correlations in social networks: A deep learning framework,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) remain the focal point of Internet usage. Since the beginning, networking sites tried best to have right privacy mechanisms in place for users, enabling them to share the right content with the right audience. With all these efforts, privacy customizations remain hard for users across the sites. Existing research that address this problem mainly focus on semi-supervised strategies that introduce extra complexity by requiring the user to manually specify initial privacy preferences for their friends. In this work, we suggest an adaptive solution that can dynamically generate privacy labels for users in OSNs. To this end, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning framework that targets two key problems in OSNs like Facebook: the exposure of users' interactions through the network to less trusted direct friends, and the possibility of propagating user updates through direct friends' interactions to indirect friends. By implementing this framework, we aim at understanding how social trust and privacy could be correlated, specifically in a dynamic fashion. We report the ranked dependence between the generated privacy labels and the estimated user trust values, which indicate the ability of the framework to identify the highly trusted users and share with them higher percentages of data.

109,1,0,2,1,On personalizing Web content through reinforcement learning,"Nowadays, a large use of personalization techniques is used to adapt Web content to usersâ habits, mainly with the aim of offering appropriate products and services. This paper presents a system that uses personalization and adaptation techniques, in order to transcode or modify contents (e.g., adapt text fonts) so as to meet preferences and needs of elderly users and users with disabilities. Such an adaptation can have a positive effect, in particular for users with some reading-related disabilities (i.e., people with dyslexia, users with low vision, users with color blindness, elderly people.). To avoid issues arising from applying transformations to the whole content, the proposed system uses Web intelligence to perform automatic adaptations on single elements composing a Web page. The transformation is applied on the basis of a reinforcement learning algorithm which manages a user profile. The system is evaluated through simulations and a real assessment, where elderly users where asked to use the system prototype for a time period and to perform some specific tasks. Results of the qualitative evaluation confirm the feasibility of the proposal, showing its validity and the usersâ appreciation.

114,1,0,2,1,Knowledge transfer between speakers for personalised dialogue management,"Model-free reinforcement learning has been shown to be a promising data driven approach for automatic dialogue policy optimization, but a relatively large amount of dialogue interactions is needed before the system reaches reasonable performance. Recently, Gaussian process based reinforcement learning methods have been shown to reduce the number of dialogues needed to reach optimal performance, and pre-training the policy with data gathered from different dialogue systems has further reduced this amount. Following this idea, a dialogue system designed for a single speaker can be initialised with data from other speakers, but if the dynamics of the speakers are very different the model will have a poor performance. When data gathered from different speakers is available, selecting the data from the most similar ones might improve the performance. We propose a method which automatically selects the data to transfer by defining a similarity measure between speakers, and uses this measure to weight the influence of the data from each speaker in the policy model. The methods are tested by simulating users with different severities of dysarthria interacting with a voice enabled environmental control system..

116,1,0,2,1,Learning to Ground in Spoken Dialogue Systems,"Machine learning methods such as reinforcement learning applied to dialogue strategy optimization has become a leading subject of researches since the mid 90's. Indeed, the great variability of factors to take into account makes the design of a spoken dialogue system a tailoring task and reusability of previous work is very difficult. Yet, techniques such as reinforcement learning are very demanding in training data while obtaining a substantial amount of data in the particular case of spoken dialogues is time-consuming and therefore expansive. In order to expand existing data sets, dialogue simulation techniques are becoming a standard solution. In this paper, we present a user model for realistic spoken dialogue simulation and a method for using this model so as to simulate the grounding process. This allows including grounding subdialogues as actions in the reinforcement learning process and learning adapted strategy.","Machine learning methods such as reinforcement learning applied to dialogue strategy optimization has become a leading subject of researches since the mid 90's.

118,1,2,2,2,A Recursive Dialogue Game for Personalized Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training,"Learning languages in addition to the native language is very important for all people in the globalized world today, and computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT) is attractive since the software can be used anywhere at any time, and repeated as many times as desired. In this paper, we introduce the immersive interaction scenario offered by spoken dialogues to CAPT by proposing a recursive dialogue game to make CAPT personalized. A number of tree-structured sub-dialogues are linked sequentially and recursively as the script for the game. The system policy at each dialogue turn is to select in real-time along the dialogue the best training sentence for each specific individual learner within the dialogue script, considering the learner's learning status and the future possible dialogue paths in the script, such that the learner can have the scores for all pronunciation units considered reaching a predefined standard in a minimum number of turns. The purpose here is that those pronunciation units poorly produced by the specific learner can be offered with more practice opportunities in the future sentences along the dialogue, which enables the learner to improve the pronunciation without having to repeat the same training sentences many times. This makes the learning process for each learner completely personalized. The dialogue policy is modeled by Markov decision process (MDP) with high-dimensional continuous state space, and trained with fitted value iteration using a huge number of simulated learners. These simulated leaners have the behavior similar to real learners, and were generated from a corpus of real learner data. The experiments demonstrated very promising results and a real cloud-based system is also successfully implemented.","Learning languages in addition to the native language is very important for all people in the globalized world today, and computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT) is attractive since the software can be used anywhere at any time, and repeated as many times as desired.

125,0,0,0,0,A unified control framework of HVAC system for thermal and acoustic comforts in office building,"Intelligent building system attracts more and more attention in both academic and industrial communities. Learning human comfort requirements and incorporating it into building control system is one of the important issues. In the traditional HVAC control system, the thermal comfort and the acoustic comfort are often conflicted and we lack of a scheme to trade off them well. In this paper, we propose a unified control framework based on reinforcement learning to balance the multiple dimension comforts, including the thermal and acoustic comforts. We utilize the user's complaints in thermal and acoustic sensations as feedback and combine the current environment and devices information to learn the personalized optimal control policy using online Q-learning. The challenge caused by the complaints is coped with an incorporated perception estimation scheme in the Q-learning reward design. Both simulation results and the field experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, especially in the adaptivity to the individual tradeoff between thermal and acoustic comfort.","Intelligent building system attracts more and more attention in both academic and industrial communities.

In this paper we propose a novel machine learning perspective toward the problem, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike other recommender systems, our system does not use the static patterns discovered from web usage data, instead it learns to make recommendations as the actions it performs in each situation. We model the problem as Q-Learning while employing concepts and techniques commonly applied in the web usage mining domain. We propose that the reinforcement learning paradigm provides an appropriate model for the recommendation problem, as well as a framework in which the system constantly interacts with the user and learns from her behavior.

Our approach is tailored for typical task-oriented human-robot dialog interactions, with no prior knowledge about the expected user and system dynamics being present. For such scenarios, we propose the use of stochastic dialog simulation for strategy learning, where the user and system error models are solely trained through the initial execution of an inexpensive Wizard-of-Oz experiment. We argue that for the addressed dialogs, already a small data corpus combined with a low-conditioned simulation model facilitates learning of strong and complex dialog strategies. To validate our overall approach, we empirically show the supremacy of the learned strategy over a hand-crafted strategy for a concrete human-robot dialog scenario.

131,2,0,2,2,Investigating Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques in Personalized Dialogue Generation,"In this paper, we propose a personalized dialogue generation system, which combines reinforcement learning techniques with an attention-based hierarchical recurrent encoderdecoder model. Firstly, we incorporate user-specific information into the decoder to capture user's background information and speaking style. Secondly, we employ reinforcement learning techniques to maximize future reward in dialogue, which enables our system to generate topic-coherent, informative and grammatical responses. Moreover, we propose three types of rewards to characterize good conversations. Finally, we compare the performance of the following reinforcement learning methods in dialogue generation: policy gradient, Q-learning, and actor-critic algorithms. We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two dialogue datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate better personalized dialogues for different users. Quantitatively, our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art dialogue systems in terms of BLEU score, perplexity, and human evaluation.

Within this framework, we describe a method for reinforcement learning of cooperative persuasive dialogue policies by defining a reward function that reflects both the system and user goal, and using framing, the use of emotionally charged statements common in persuasive dialogue between humans. In order to construct the various components necessary for reinforcement learning, we first describe a corpus of persuasive dialogues between human interlocutors, then propose a method to construct user simulators and reward functions specifically tailored to persuasive dialogue based on this corpus. Then, we implement a fully automatic text-based dialogue system for evaluating the learned policies. Using the implemented dialogue system, we evaluate the learned policy and the effect of framing through experiments both with a user simulator and with real users.

134,1,0,1,1,Improving user satisfaction in agent-based electronic marketplaces by reputation modelling and adjustable product quality,"In this paper, we propose a market model and learning algorithms for buying and selling agents in electronic marketplaces. We take into account the fact that multiple selling agents may offer the same good with different qualities, and that selling agents may alter the quality of their goods. We also consider the possible existence of dishonest selling agents in the market. In our approach, buying agents learn to maximize their expected value of goods using reinforcement learning. In addition, they model and exploit the reputation of selling agents to avoid interaction with the disreputable ones, and therefore to reduce the risk of purchasing low value goods. Our selling agents learn to maximize their expected profits by using reinforcement learning to adjust product prices, and also by altering product quality to provide more customized value to their goods. This paper focuses on presenting results from experiments investigating the behaviours of buying and selling agents in large-sized electronic marketplaces. Our results confirm that buying and selling agents following the proposed algorithms obtain greater satisfaction than buying and selling agents who only use reinforcement learning, with the buying agents not modelling sellers' reputation and the selling agents not adjusting product quality.","In this paper, we propose a market model and learning algorithms for buying and selling agents in electronic marketplaces.

136,2,0,2,2,Personalized ad recommendation systems for life-time value optimization with guarantees,"In this paper, we propose a framework for using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn good policies for personalized ad recommendation (PAR) systems. The RL algorithms take into account the long-term effect of an action, and thus, could be more suitable than myopic techniques like supervised learning and contextual bandit, for modern PAR systems in which the number of returning visitors is rapidly growing. However, while myopic techniques have been well-studied in PAR systems, the RL approach is still in its infancy, mainly due to two fundamental challenges: how to compute a good RL strategy and how to evaluate a solution using historical data to ensure its ""safety"" before deployment. In this paper, we propose to use a family of off-policy evaluation techniques with statistical guarantees to tackle both these challenges. We apply these methods to a real PAR problem, both for evaluating the final performance and for optimizing the parameters of the RL algorithm. Our results show that a RL algorithm equipped with these offpolicy evaluation techniques outperforms the myopic approaches. Our results also give fundamental insights on the difference between the click through rate (CTR) and life-time value (LTV) metrics for evaluating the performance of a PAR algorithm.","In this paper, we propose a framework for using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to learn good policies for personalized ad recommendation (PAR) systems.

The system employs Web intelligence to perform these automatic adaptations on single elements composing a Web page. In particular, a reinforcement learning algorithm, i.e. Q-learning, based on the idea of reward/punishment is utilized as the machine learning system that manages the user profile. Based on it, the user profile is updated, so that automatic adaptations can be effectively performed while surfing the Web. We created a simulation scenario to test our approach over different users with specific preferences and/or different kinds of disabilities.

142,0,0,1,0,Constructing an intelligent behavior avatar in a virtual world: a self-learning model based on reinforcement,"In this paper, a novel method for personal intelligent behavior avatar (IBA) is proposed to acquire autonomous behavior based on the interactions between user and smart objects in the virtual environment. In this method, the behavior decision model and the self-learning model are integrated by Bayesian networks and reinforcement learning. The Bayesian networks can treat interaction experiences using statistical processes, and the sureness of decision making is represented by certainty factors using stochastic reasoning. The reinforcement learning is implemented by learning experimentation or trial and error mechanisms to improve the performance of IBA through feedback. Therefore, the IBA makes a strategic decision that is approximated and appropriate to the user through the self-learning process by reinforcement learning. Finally, the feasibility of this method is investigated by imitating user's behavior and the results of self-learning process. The results of simulation show that the method is successful in imitating user's behavior and improving the performance of IBA.","In this paper, a novel method for personal intelligent behavior avatar (IBA) is proposed to acquire autonomous behavior based on the interactions between user and smart objects in the virtual environment.

143,1,2,0,1,A Fast Interactive Search System for Healthcare Services,"In this paper we describe the design, development, and evaluation of a general human-machine interaction search system, and its potential and use in the context of a collaboration project with SAP and Saffron. The objective of a specialized version of the system is to provide medical and healthcare information services to users via interactive search for personalized patient needs. Patients usually have questions regarding healthcare, including those which concern illness symptoms, duration and types of treatment, possible drug effects, and more. Authorized personnel would often be ideal in responding to such needs; however they could potentially be very expensive, and not easy to support and maintain. If patients could have access to information at their home, by means of i-phone or online access, this could save time, doctor office visit expenses, as well as valuable and restricted medical time. What is more, information concerning other anonymized and similar patient cases provides knowledge and perspective on a wide range of patient issues. From the doctors' perspective, they typically need to spend time on differential analysis about new patient cases: study symptoms, research possible causes, rank results by emergency priority and treat them accordingly. A search system that would direct a doctor (or patient/user) to similar patient cases would save significant amount of manual search time. The powerful new feature of this system is the storage and mining of past patient cases knowledge, to create metadata to be used in the subsequent retrieval of relevant documents. Finally, the interactive search system would speed up identification of rare cases; for instance, symptoms that do not appear commonly in past cases may require special treatment or expert referral. We build a model which dynamically learns medical needs of interacting MDs and patients. The model works on free or unstructured text, allowing disambiguation of vague words and flexibility in descri- ing medical needs. In addition, both experts with an advanced knowledge of medical terminology, and beginning users using basic medical terms, can achieve high search relevance. Furthermore, our approach obviates the need for the assignment of tags or labels, such as treatment, symptoms, causes, to documents, to respond effectively to user queries. In particular, we build a temporal difference algorithm to predict user's information needs by incorporating both current and predicted knowledge into learning the user profile. Our source of information about the user consists of submitted queries and feedback on the returned results. We tested our system on publicly available medical data (OhsuMed TREC dataset 2002) and we achieved a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy, compared to the literature. We provide quantitative results as well as demonstration screenshots which illustrate a) the value of interaction (user time spent with system versus results accuracy), b) the value of using medical terminology understanding, when compared with simple general words, and c) the value of allowing the maximum number of feedback submissions to vary.","In this paper we describe the design, development, and evaluation of a general human-machine interaction search system, and its potential and use in the context of a collaboration project with SAP and Saffron.

145,2,0,1,1,Towards learning reward functions from user interactions,"In the physical world, people have dynamic preferences, e.g., the same situation can lead to satisfaction for some humans and to frustration for others. Personalization is called for. The same observation holds for online behavior with interactive systems. It is natural to represent the behavior of users who are engaging with interactive systems such as a search engine or a recommender system, as a sequence of actions where each next action depends on the current situation and the user reward of taking a particular action. By and large, current online evaluation metrics for interactive systems such as search engines or recommender systems, are static and do not reflect differences in user behavior. They rarely capture or model the reward experienced by a user while interacting with an interactive system.We argue that knowing a user's reward function is essential for an interactive system as both for learning and evaluation. We propose to learn users' reward functions directly from observed interaction traces. In particular, we present how users' reward functions can be uncovered directly using inverse reinforcement learning techniques. We also show how to incorporate user features into the learning process. Our main contribution is a novel and dynamic approach to restore a user's reward function. We present an analytic approach to this problem and complement it with initial experiments using the interaction logs of a cultural heritage institution that demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by uncovering different reward functions for different user groups.

The trading platforms nowadays has resulted in information explosion that makes buyers unable to retrieve and analyze entire merchandise information easily and, therefore, decreases their negotiation power. Moreover, without the records of buyers ' transaction preference, it 's not easy for most agent systems to help common buyers to increase their negotiation power. In this paper, we propose the Learning Personalized Mobile Shopping Agent (LPMSA) and apply it to three e-Marketplace architectures: alliance, broker, noncooperation. The buyer can dispatch mobile agents to multiple e-Marketplaces for collecting merchandise information, negotiating with sellers, and buying merchandise from the above architectures. Furthermore, the agent can learn more about buyer's preference. As a result, the proposed architecture can not only find suitable trading partners for buyers but also help them to get better deals.","In the B2C- or C2C- based e-Marketplaces, the same merchandise is sold by different sellers in different e-Marketplaces. The trading platforms nowadays has resulted in information explosion that makes buyers unable to retrieve and analyze entire merchandise information easily and, therefore, decreases their negotiation power. Moreover, without the records of buyers ' transaction preference, it 's not easy for most agent systems to help common buyers to increase their negotiation power. In this paper, we propose the Learning Personalized Mobile Shopping Agent (LPMSA) and apply it to three e-Marketplace architectures: alliance, broker, noncooperation. The buyer can dispatch mobile agents to multiple e-Marketplaces for collecting merchandise information, negotiating with sellers, and buying merchandise from the above architectures. Furthermore, the agent can learn more about buyer's preference. As a result, the proposed architecture can not only find suitable trading partners for buyers but also help them to get better deals.",,"Department of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology, 168, GiFeng East Road, Wufeng, Taichung County, Taiwan",,,Automated Negotiation; E-Marketplace; Mobile Agent; Reinforcement Learning,Author4,Author1,a,a,a,a,a,a,Personal Assistants,,,,a,a,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IC-AI'04",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-12744281483&partnerID=40&md5=d315d9774254985d85ee436efabd63d8,"Lee F.-M., Li L.-H., Liu Y.-C.","Lee, F.-M., Department of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology, 168, GiFeng East Road, Wufeng, Taichung County, Taiwan; Li, L.-H., Department of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology, 168, GiFeng East Road, Wufeng, Taichung County, Taiwan; Liu, Y.-C., Department of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology, 168, GiFeng East Road, Wufeng, Taichung County, Taiwan",,,,SCOPUS,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2-s2.0-12744281483,,,,,783,777,,,,,Scopus,,,,Conference Paper,,,2,,2004,2004,3,1,0,Author1
148,2,0,1,1,Optimistic bayesian sampling in contextual-bandit problems,"In sequential decision problems in an unknown environment, the decision maker often faces a dilemma over whether to explore to discover more about the environment, or to exploit current knowledge. We address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a general setting encompassing both standard and contextualised bandit problems. The contextual bandit problem has recently resurfaced in attempts to maximise click-through rates in web based applications, a task with significant commercial interest. In this article we consider an approach of Thompson (1933) which makes use of samples from the posterior distributions for the instantaneous value of each action. We extend the approach by introducing a new algorithm, Optimistic Bayesian Sampling (OBS), in which the probability of playing an action increases with the uncertainty in the estimate of the action value. This results in better directed exploratory behaviour. We prove that, under unrestrictive assumptions, both approaches result in optimal behaviour with respect to the average reward criterion of Yang and Zhu (2002). We implement OBS and measure its performance in simulated Bernoulli bandit and linear regression domains, and also when tested with the task of personalised news article recommendation on a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module data set. We find that OBS performs competitively when compared to recently proposed benchmark algorithms and outperforms Thompson's method throughout. Â© 2012 Benedict C.

150,2,0,2,2,Making better recommendations with online profiling agents,"In recent years, we have witnessed the success of autonomous agents applying machine learning techniques across a wide range of applications. However, agents applying the same machine learning techniques in online applications have not been so successful. Even agent-based hybrid recommender systems that combine information filtering techniques with collaborative filtering techniques have only been applied with considerable success to simple consumer goods such as movies, books, clothing and food. Complex, adaptive autonomous agent systems that can handle complex goods such as real estate, vacation plans, insurance, mutual funds, and mortgage have yet emerged. To a large extent, the reinforcement learning methods developed to aid agents in learning have been more successfully deployed in offline applications. The inherent limitations in these methods have rendered them somewhat ineffective in online applications. In this paper, we postulate that a small amount of prior knowledge and human-provided input can dramatically speed up online learning. We will demonstrate that our agent HumanE - with its prior knowledge or ""experiences"" about the real estate domain -can effectively assist users in identifying requirements, especially unstated ones, quickly and unobtrusively.","In recent years, we have witnessed the success of autonomous agents applying machine learning techniques across a wide range of applications.

However, state-of-the-art quality selection heuristics are deterministic and tailored to specific network configurations. Therefore, they are unable to cope with a vast range of highly dynamic network settings. In this letter, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based HAS client is presented and evaluated.

153,1,0,2,1,Personalized Course Sequence Recommendations,"Given the variability in student learning, it is becoming increasingly important to tailor courses as well as course sequences to student needs. This paper presents a systematic methodology for offering personalized course sequence recommendations to students. First, a forward-search backward-induction algorithm is developed that can optimally select course sequences to decrease the time required for a student to graduate. The algorithm accounts for prerequisite requirements (typically present in higher level education) and course availability. Second, using the tools of multiarmed bandits, an algorithm is developed that can optimally recommend a course sequence that both reduces the time to graduate while also increasing the overall GPA of the student. The algorithm dynamically learns how students with different contextual backgrounds perform for given course sequences and, then, recommends an optimal course sequence for new students. Using real-world student data from the UCLA Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, we illustrate how the proposed algorithms outperform other methods that do not include student contextual information when making course sequence recommendations.","Given the variability in student learning, it is becoming increasingly important to tailor courses as well as course sequences to student needs.

This paper proposes a personalized difficulty adjustment technique for a rehabilitation game that automatically regulates difficulty settings based on a patient's skills in real-time. To this end, ideas from reinforcement learning are used to dynamically adjust the difficulty of a game. We show that difficulty adjustment is a multiple-objective problem, in which some objectives might be evaluated at different periods. To address this problem, we propose and use Multiple-Periodic Reinforcement Learning (MPRL) that makes it possible to evaluate different objectives of difficulty adjustment in separate periods.

This paper proposed a multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm (MORLA) to design neurocontroller with the personal preference. It transformed the multi-objective into synthetical objective and applied parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) to evolve the neurocontroller according to the synthetical objective. To establish the synthetical objective, the objective weight which represents the personal preference is calculated by solving the constrained optimization problem (COP) at the end of each generation. The COP requires not only the biggest variance of the synthetical objective in the population, but also requires the weight to fit the designerpsilas preference. After acquiring the weights, the PGA can select the elitists from the population according to the designerpsilas preference and design a satisfying neurocontroller by evolutionary operations. At last, the MORLA is used to design neurocontroller for a speed-controlled induction motor drive with indirect vector control.

Different individuals will play with different gaming styles and employ different strategic approaches. This often involves interacting with nonplayer characters that are controlled by the game AI. From a developer's standpoint, it is important to design a game AI that is able to satisfy the variety of players that will interact with the game. Thus, an adaptive game AI that can scale the difficulty of the game according to the proficiency of the player has greater potential to customize a personalized and entertaining game experience compared to a static game AI. In particular, dynamic game difficulty scaling refers to the use of an adaptive game AI that performs game adaptations in real time during the game session. This paper presents two adaptive algorithms that use ideas from reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation to improve player satisfaction by scaling the difficulty of the game AI while the game is being played. The effects of varying the learning and mutation rates are examined and a general rule of thumb for the parameters is proposed. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated to be capable of matching its opponents in terms of mean scores and winning percentages. Both algorithms are able to generalize well to a variety of opponents.","Games are played by a wide variety of audiences.

These descriptions should be natural and intuitive for the human users. In this paper, we present an algorithm that learns how to provide good route descriptions from a corpus of human-written directions. Using inverse reinforcement learning, our algorithm learns how to select the information for the description depending on the context of the route segment. The algorithm then uses the learned policy to generate directions that imitate the style of the descriptions provided by humans, thus taking into account personal as well as cultural preferences and special requirements of the particular user group providing the learning demonstrations. We evaluate our approach in a user study and show that the directions generated by our policy sound similar to human-given directions and substantially more natural than directions provided by commercial web services.","For several applications, robots and other computer systems must provide route descriptions to humans.

The algorithm then uses the learned policy to generate directions that imitate the style of the descriptions provided by humans, thus taking into account personal as well as cultural preferences and special requirements of the particular user group providing the learning demonstrations. We evaluate our approach in a user study and show that the directions generated by our policy sound similar to human-given directions and substantially more natural than directions provided by commercial web services.",,,,"Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, 79110 Freiburg, Germany",,Author1,Author2,a,a,a,a,a,a,Personal Assistants,,,,a,a,2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907334,,S.

158,1,1,1,1,Agent-based assistance in ambient assisted living through reinforcement learning and semantic technologies: (Short paper),"For impaired people, the conduction of certain daily life activities is problematic due to motoric and cognitive handicaps. For that reason, assistive agents in ambient assisted environments provide services that aim at supporting elderly and impaired people. However, these agents act in complex stochastic and indeterministic environments where the concrete effects of a performed action are usually unknown at design time. Furthermore, they have to perform varying tasks according to the userâs context and needs, wherefore an agent has to be flexible and able to recognize required capabilities in a certain situation in order to provide adequate, unobtrusive assistance. Hence, an expressive representation framework is required that relates user-specific impairments to required agent capabilities. This work presents an approach which (a) describes and links user impairments and capabilities using the formal, model-theoretic semantics expressed in OWL2 DL ontologies, (b) computes optimal policies through Reinforcement Learning and propagates these in an agent network. The presented approach improves the collaborative, personalized and adequate assistance of assistive agents and tailors the agent-based services to the userâs missing capabilities.

This area gives them comfort about interactions and its size usually depends on various factors such as culture, personal traits, and acquaintanceship. This issue may also arise in case of human-robot interaction, especially when the robot is required to generate a socially competent interaction strategy toward people they are interacting with. Here, we propose a new robot exploration strategy to socially interact with people by considering the social relationship between the robot and each person. To that end, two definitions of interaction area are made: (1) Acceptable area allowed to be shared with other people and robots, and (2) Private area where a human does not want to be interfered by others. Based on these definitions, the robot can optimize the path to maximize the frequency/degree of visiting the acceptable area of each person and to minimize the frequency/degree of trespassing into the private area of them at the same time in an iterative way. In this paper, the social force model (SFM) of each person, based on the potential field concept, is designed by a fuzzy inference system and its parameter is optimized by the reinforcement learning model during interactions. We have shown that the proposed model can generate a suitable SFM of each person, which was quite similar to a ground truth model, allowing to plan a path to simultaneously optimize the two factors of interaction area, respectively.","Each person has their private physical and/or psychological area where they do not want to share with others during social interactions.

162,2,2,0,2,New Statistical Learning Methods for Estimating Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes,"Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are sequential decision rules for individual patients that can adapt over time to an evolving illness. The goal is to accommodate heterogeneity among patients and find the DTR which will produce the best long-term outcome if implemented. We introduce two new statistical learning methods for estimating the optimal DTR, termed backward outcome weighted learning (BOWL), and simultaneous outcome weighted learning (SOWL). These approaches convert individualized treatment selection into an either sequential or simultaneous classification problem, and can thus be applied by modifying existing machine learning techniques. The proposed methods are based on directly maximizing over all DTRs a nonparametric estimator of the expected long-term outcome; this is fundamentally different than regression-based methods, for example, Q-learning, which indirectly attempt such maximization and rely heavily on the correctness of postulated regression models. Â We prove that the resulting rules are consistent, and provide finite sample bounds for the errors using the estimated rules. Simulation results suggest the proposed methods produce superior DTRs compared with Q-learning especially in small samples.

163,0,0,1,0,An Effective Approach to Continuous User Authentication for Touch Screen Smart Devices,"Due to the rapid increase in the use of personal smart devices, more sensitive data is stored and viewed on these smart devices. This trend makes it easier for attackers to access confidential data by physically compromising (including stealing) these smart devices. Currently, most personal smart devices employ one of the one-time user authentication schemes, such as four-to-six digits, fingerprint or pattern-based schemes. These authentication schemes are often not good enough for securing personal smart devices because the attackers can easily extract all the confidential data from the smart device by breaking such schemes, or by keeping the authenticated session open on a physically compromised smart device. In addition, existing re-authentication or continuous authentication techniques for protecting personal smart devices use centralized architecture and require servers at a centralized location to train and update the learning model used for continuous authentication, which impose additional communication overhead. In this paper, an approach is presented to generating and updating the authentication model on the user's smart device with user's gestures, instead of a centralized server. There are two major advantages in this approach. One is that this approach continuously learns and authenticates finger gestures of the user in the background without requiring the user to provide specific gesture inputs. The other major advantage is to have better authentication accuracy by treating uninterrupted user finger gestures over a short time interval as a single gesture for continuous user authentication.","Due to the rapid increase in the use of personal smart devices, more sensitive data is stored and viewed on these smart devices.

167,1,0,2,1,Interactive narrative personalization with deep reinforcement learning,"Data-driven techniques for interactive narrative generation are the subject of growing interest. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant potential for devising data-driven interactive narrative generators that tailor players' story experiences by inducing policies from player interaction logs. A key open question in RL-based interactive narrative generation is how to model complex player interaction patterns to learn effective policies. In this paper we present a deep RL-based interactive narrative generation framework that leverages synthetic data produced by a bipartite simulated player model. Specifically, the framework involves training a set of Q-networks to control adaptable narrative event sequences with long short-term memory network-based simulated players. We investigate the deep RL framework's performance with an educational interactive narrative, Crystal Island. Results suggest that the deep RL-based narrative generation framework yields effective personalized interactive narratives.","Data-driven techniques for interactive narrative generation are the subject of growing interest.

168,1,0,2,1,Exploration in interactive personalized music recommendation: A reinforcement learning approach,"Current music recommender systems typically act in a greedymanner by recommending songs with the highest user ratings. Greedy recommendation, however, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather information on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are potentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs to explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation. This article presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this exploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task. To learn user preferences, it uses Bayesian model that accounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A piecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference algorithm help to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit of our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and playlist generation. We demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed approach with simulation results and a user study.

169,1,0,2,1,Dynamic personalization in conversational recommender systems,"Conversational recommender systems are E-Commerce applications which interactively assist online users to acquire their interaction goals during their sessions. In our previous work, we have proposed and validated a methodology for conversational systems which autonomously learns the particular web page to display to the user, at each step of the session. We employed reinforcement learning to learn an optimal strategy, i.e., one that is personalized for a real user population. In this paper, we extend our methodology by allowing it to autonomously learn and update the optimal strategy dynamically (at run-time), and individually for each user. This learning occurs perpetually after every session, as long as the user continues her interaction with the system. We evaluate our approach in an off-line simulation with four simulated users, as well as in an online evaluation with thirteen real users. The results show that an optimal strategy is learnt and updated for each real and simulated user. For each simulated user, the optimal behavior is reasonably adapted to this userâs characteristics, but converges after several hundred sessions. For each real user, the optimal behavior converges only in several sessions. It provides assistance only in certain situations, allowing many users to buy several products together in shorter time and with more page-views and lesser number of query executions. We prove that our approach is novel and show how its current limitations can catered.

170,2,0,2,2,Online context-aware recommendation with time varying multi-armed bandit,"Contextual multi-armed bandit problems have gained increasing popularity and attention in recent years due to their capability of leveraging contextual information to deliver online personalized recommendation services (e.g., online advertising and news article selection). To predict the reward of each arm given a particular context, existing relevant research studies for contextual multi-armed bandit problems often assume the existence of a fixed yet unknown reward mapping function. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice, since real-world problems often involve underlying processes that are dynamically evolving over time. In this paper, we study the time varying contextual multi-armed problem where the reward mapping function changes over time. In particular, we propose a dynamical context drift model based on particle learning. In the proposed model, the drift on the reward mapping function is explicitly modeled as a set of random walk particles, where good fitted particles are selected to learn the mapping dynamically. Taking advantage of the fully adaptive inference strategy of particle learning, our model is able to effectively capture the context change and learn the latent parameters. In addition, those learnt parameters can be naturally integrated into existing multi-arm selection strategies such as LinUCB and Thompson sampling. Empirical studies on two real-world applications, including online personalized advertising and news recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results also show that our algorithm can dynamically track the changing reward over time and consequently improve the click-through rate.

Intuitively, user preferences can be reasonably embedded in a coarse low-dimensional feature space that can be explored efficiently, requiring exploration in the high-dimensional space only as necessary. We introduce a bandit algorithm that explores within this coarse-to-fine spectrum, and prove performance guarantees that depend on how well the coarse space captures the user's preferences.

174,2,1,0,1,Using Contextual Learning to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy: Application in Breast Cancer Screening,"Clinicians need to routinely make management decisions about patients who are at risk for a disease such as breast cancer. This paper presents a novel clinical decision support tool that is capable of helping physicians make diagnostic decisions. We apply this support system to improve the specificity of breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The system utilizes clinical context (e.g., demographics, medical history) to minimize the false positive rates while avoiding false negatives. An online contextual learning algorithm is used to update the diagnostic strategy presented to the physicians over time. We analytically evaluate the diagnostic performance loss of the proposed algorithm, in which the true patient distribution is not known and needs to be learned, as compared with the optimal strategy where all information is assumed known, and prove that the false positive rate of the proposed learning algorithm asymptotically converges to the optimum. In addition, our algorithm also has the important merit that it can provide individualized confidence estimates about the accuracy of the diagnosis recommendation. Moreover, the relevancy of contextual features is assessed, enabling the approach to identify specific contextual features that provide the most value of information in reducing diagnostic errors. Experiments were conducted using patient data collected at a large academic medical center. Our proposed approach outperforms the current clinical practice by 36% in terms of false positive rate given a 2% false negative rate.","Clinicians need to routinely make management decisions about patients who are at risk for a disease such as breast cancer.

The first is a user-centred evaluation where we have achieved a precision at 60% and recall at 80% for VIG identification. In the second study using military chat data, we have demonstrated an average precision of 45% to 50%.

Server weblog files have abundant information about the user's current interests. This information can be mined and analyzed therefore the administrators may be able to guide the users in their browsing activity so they may obtain relevant information in a shorter span of time to obtain user satisfaction. Web-based technology facilitates the creation of personally meaningful and socially useful knowledge through supportive interactions, communication and collaboration among educators, learners and information. This paper suggests a new methodology based on learning techniques for a Web-based Multiagent-based application to discover the hidden patterns in the user's visited links. It presents a new approach that involves unsupervised, reinforcement learning, and cooperation between agents. It is utilized to discover patterns that represent the user's profiles in a sample website into specific categories of materials using significance percentages. These profiles are used to make recommendations of interesting links and categories to the user. The experimental results of the approach showed successful user pattern recognition, and cooperative learning among agents to obtain user profiles.

178,1,1,0,1,The use of reinforcement learning algorithms to meet the challenges of an artificial pancreas.,"Blood glucose control, for example, in diabetes mellitus or severe illness, requires strict adherence to a protocol of food, insulin administration and exercise personalized to each patient. An artificial pancreas for automated treatment could boost quality of glucose control and patients' independence. The components required for an artificial pancreas are: i) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), ii) smart controllers and iii) insulin pumps delivering the optimal amount of insulin. In recent years, medical devices for CGM and insulin administration have undergone rapid progression and are now commercially available. Yet, clinically available devices still require regular patients' or caregivers' attention as they operate in open-loop control with frequent user intervention. Dosage-calculating algorithms are currently being studied in intensive care patients [1] , for short overnight control to supplement conventional insulin delivery [2] , and for short periods where patients rest and follow a prescribed food regime [3] . Fully automated algorithms that can respond to the varying activity levels seen in outpatients, with unpredictable and unreported food intake, and which provide the necessary personalized control for individuals is currently beyond the state-of-the-art. Here, we review and discuss reinforcement learning algorithms, controlling insulin in a closed-loop to provide individual insulin dosing regimens that are reactive to the immediate needs of the patient.","Blood glucose control, for example, in diabetes mellitus or severe illness, requires strict adherence to a protocol of food, insulin administration and exercise personalized to each patient.

Nevertheless, most of the people who have diabetes lead a sedentary lifestyle. Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to help type 2 diabetes patients increase the level of their physical activity.METHODS: We provided 27 sedentary type 2 diabetes patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent short message service messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning algorithm so as to improve each participant's compliance with the activity regimen. The algorithm was compared with a static policy for sending messages and weekly reminders.RESULTS: Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the learning algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, whereas the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the learning algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) compared with control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise.CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone apps coupled with a learning algorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. This algorithm can be used in large populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control. Our results can be expanded to other areas where computer-led health coaching of humans may have a positive impact.

183,0,0,0,0,Path planning with user route preference - A reward surface approximation approach using orthogonal Legendre polynomials,"As self driving cars become more ubiquitous, users would look for natural ways of informing the car AI about their personal choice of routes. This choice is not always dictated by straightforward logic such as shortest distance or shortest time, and can be influenced by hidden factors, such as comfort and familiarity. This paper presents a path learning algorithm for such applications, where from limited positive demonstrations, an autonomous agent learns the user's path preference and honors that choice in its route planning, but has the capability to adopt alternate routes, if the original choice(s) become impractical. The learning problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. The states (way-points) and actions (to move from one way-point to another) are pre-defined according to the existing network of paths between the origin and destination and the user's demonstration is assumed to be a sample of the preferred path. The underlying reward function which captures the essence of the demonstration is computed using an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm and from that the entire path mirroring the expert's demonstration is extracted. To alleviate the problem of state space explosion when dealing with a large state space, the reward function is approximated using a set of orthogonal polynomial basis functions with a fixed number of coefficients regardless of the size of the state space. A six fold reduction in total learning time is achieved compared to using simple basis functions, that has dimensionality equal to the number of distinct states.","As self driving cars become more ubiquitous, users would look for natural ways of informing the car AI about their personal choice of routes.

A six fold reduction in total learning time is achieved compared to using simple basis functions, that has dimensionality equal to the number of distinct states.",,,,"Department of Mechanical Aerospace and Biomedical Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, 37996 USA",,Author4,Author1,a,a,a,a,a,a,Personal Assistants,,Personalized navigation system.,,a,a,2016 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7743527,,A.

184,2,2,0,2,Personalized tuning of a reinforcement learning control algorithm for glucose regulation,"Artificial pancreas is in the forefront of research towards the automatic insulin infusion for patients with type 1 diabetes. Due to the high inter- and intra-variability of the diabetic population, the need for personalized approaches has been raised. This study presents an adaptive, patient-specific control strategy for glucose regulation based on reinforcement learning and more specifically on the Actor-Critic (AC) learning approach. The control algorithm provides daily updates of the basal rate and insulin-to-carbohydrate (IC) ratio in order to optimize glucose regulation. A method for the automatic and personalized initialization of the control algorithm is designed based on the estimation of the transfer entropy (TE) between insulin and glucose signals. The algorithm has been evaluated in silico in adults, adolescents and children for 10 days. Three scenarios of initialization to i) zero values, ii) random values and iii) TE-based values have been comparatively assessed. The results have shown that when the TE-based initialization is used, the algorithm achieves faster learning with 98%, 90% and 73% in the A+B zones of the Control Variability Grid Analysis for adults, adolescents and children respectively after five days compared to 95%, 78%, 41% for random initialization and 93%, 88%, 41% for zero initial values. Furthermore, in the case of children, the daily Low Blood Glucose Index reduces much faster when the TE-based tuning is applied. The results imply that automatic and personalized tuning based on TE reduces the learning period and improves the overall performance of the AC algorithm.","Artificial pancreas is in the forefront of research towards the automatic insulin infusion for patients with type 1 diabetes.

186,2,1,0,1,Model-free machine learning in biomedicine: Feasibility study in type 1 diabetes,"Although reinforcement learning (RL) is suitable for highly uncertain systems, the applicability of this class of algorithms to medical treatment may be limited by the patient variability which dictates individualised tuning for their usually multiple algorithmic parameters. This study explores the feasibility of RL in the framework of artificial pancreas development for type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this approach, an Actor-Critic (AC) learning algorithm is designed and developed for the optimisation of insulin infusion for personalised glucose regulation. AC optimises the daily basal insulin rate and insulin:carbohydrate ratio for each patient, on the basis of his/her measured glucose profile. Automatic, personalised tuning of AC is based on the estimation of information transfer (IT) from insulin to glucose signals. Insulinto-glucose IT is linked to patient-specific characteristics related to total daily insulin needs and insulin sensitivity (SI). The AC algorithm is evaluated using an FDA-accepted T1D simulator on a large patient database under a complex meal protocol, meal uncertainty and diurnal SI variation. The results showed that 95.66% of time was spent in normoglycaemia in the presence of meal uncertainty and 93.02% when meal uncertainty and SI variation were simultaneously considered. The time spent in hypoglycaemia was 0.27% in both cases. The novel tuning method reduced the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, especially in patients with low SI. Â© 2016 Daskalaki et al.

187,1,0,0,0,Studies on Drivers' Driving Styles Based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"Although advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been widely introduced in automotive industry to enhance driving safety and comfort, and to reduce drivers' driving burden, they do not in general reflect different drivers' driving styles or customized with individual personalities. This can be important to comfort and enjoyable driving experience, and to improved market acceptance. However, it is challenging to understand and further identify drivers' driving styles due to large number and great variations of driving population. Previous research has mainly adopted physical approaches in modeling drivers' driving behavior, which however are often very much limited, if not impossible, in capturing human drivers' driving characteristics. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning based approach, in which the driving styles are formulated through drivers' learning processes from interaction with surrounding environment. Based on the reinforcement learning theory, driving action can be treated as maximizing a reward function. Instead of calibrating the unknown reward function to satisfy driver's desired response, we try to recover it from the human driving data, utilizing maximum likelihood inverse reinforcement learning (MLIRL). An IRL-based longitudinal driving assistance system is also proposed in this paper. Firstly, large amount of real world driving data is collected from a test vehicle, and the data is split into two sets for training and for testing purposes respectively. Then, the longitudinal acceleration is modeled as a Boltzmann distribution in human driving activity. The reward function is denoted as a linear combination of some kernelized basis functions. The driving style parameter vector is estimated using MLIRL based on the training set. Finally, a learning-based longitudinal driving assistance algorithm is developed and evaluated on the testing set. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can satisfactorily reflect human drivers' driving behavior.

However, accurate HRTF measurement is usually difficult. While previous studies have proposed methods of HRTF personalization without HRTF measurement, localization errors often remain and further modifications are challenging. This research proposes a method that uses reinforcement learning and listener evaluation to obtain an accurate individual HRTF without measurement. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept simulation with an experiment involving human subjects. In the simulation, it was confirmed that the proposed method could acquire individual HRTFs close to the measured dummy-head HRTF. A learning experiment in one direction used the proposed method without individual HRTFs. The results showed improved horizontal-plane localization for the learned HRTF as compared to the dummy-head HRTF. These experiments collectively demonstrate the possibility of the proposed reinforcement-learning-based personalization method for individual HRTFs that enables listeners to experience accurate virtual sound environments.","Accurately perceiving spatial locations of virtual sounds using stereo earphones or headphones requires individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) for each listener.

191,2,1,0,1,Controlling blood glucose variability under uncertainty using reinforcement learning and Gaussian processes,"Abstract Automated control of blood glucose (BG) concentration with a fully automated artificial pancreas will certainly improve the quality of life for insulin-dependent patients. Closed-loop insulin delivery is challenging due to inter- and intra-patient variability, errors in glucose sensors and delays in insulin absorption. Responding to the varying activity levels seen in outpatients, with unpredictable and unreported food intake, and providing the necessary personalized control for individuals is a challenging task for existing control algorithms. A novel approach for controlling glycemic variability using simulation-based learning is presented. A policy iteration algorithm that combines reinforcement learning with Gaussian process approximation is proposed. To account for multiple sources of uncertainty, a control policy is learned off-line using an Ito's stochastic model of the glucose-insulin dynamics. For safety and performance, only relevant data are sampled through Bayesian active learning. Results obtained demonstrate that a generic policy is both safe and efficient for controlling subject-specific variability due to a patient's lifestyle and its distinctive metabolic response.

192,2,0,1,1,Reinforcement learning utilizes proxemics: An avatar learns to manipulate the position of people in immersive virtual reality,"A reinforcement learning (RL) method was used to train a virtual character to move participants to a specified location. The virtual environment depicted an alleyway displayed through a wide field-of-view head-tracked stereo head-mounted display. Based on proxemics theory, we predicted that when the character approached within a personal or intimate distance to the participants, they would be inclined to move backwards out of the way. We carried out a between-groups experiment with 30 female participants, with 10 assigned arbitrarily to each of the following three groups: In the Intimate condition the character could approach within 0.38m and in the Social condition no nearer than 1.2m. In the Random condition the actions of the virtual character were chosen randomly from among the same set as in the RL method, and the virtual character could approach within 0.38m. The experiment continued in each case until the participant either reached the target or 7 minutes had elapsed. The distributions of the times taken to reach the target showed significant differences between the three groups, with 9 out of 10 in the Intimate condition reaching the target significantly faster than the 6 out of 10 who reached the target in the Social condition. Only 1 out of 10 in the Random condition reached the target. The experiment is an example of applied presence theory: we rely on the many findings that people tend to respond realistically in immersive virtual environments, and use this to get people to achieve a task of which they had been unaware. This method opens up the door for many such applications where the virtual environment adapts to the responses of the human participants with the aim of achieving particular goals.

The virtual environment depicted an alleyway displayed through a wide field-of-view head-tracked stereo head-mounted display. Based on proxemics theory, we predicted that when the character approached within a personal or intimate distance to the participants, they would be inclined to move backwards out of the way. We carried out a between-groups experiment with 30 female participants, with 10 assigned arbitrarily to each of the following three groups: In the Intimate condition the character could approach within 0.38m and in the Social condition no nearer than 1.2m. In the Random condition the actions of the virtual character were chosen randomly from among the same set as in the RL method, and the virtual character could approach within 0.38m. The experiment continued in each case until the participant either reached the target or 7 minutes had elapsed. The distributions of the times taken to reach the target showed significant differences between the three groups, with 9 out of 10 in the Intimate condition reaching the target significantly faster than the 6 out of 10 who reached the target in the Social condition. Only 1 out of 10 in the Random condition reached the target. The experiment is an example of applied presence theory: we rely on the many findings that people tend to respond realistically in immersive virtual environments, and use this to get people to achieve a task of which they had been unaware. This method opens up the door for many such applications where the virtual environment adapts to the responses of the human participants with the aim of achieving particular goals.

193,2,1,1,1,A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Emotion-based Automatic Playlist Generation,"A novel trend emerged in music exploration is to organize and search songs according to their emotions. However, research on automatic playlist generation (APG) primarily focuses on metadata and audio similarity. Mainstream solutions view APG as a static problem. This paper argues that the APG problem is better modeled as a continuous optimization problem, and proposes an adaptive preference model for personalized APG based on emotions. The main idea is to collect a user's behavior in music playing, e.g., rating, skipping and replaying, as immediate feedback in learning the user's preferences for music emotion within a playlist. Reinforcement learning is adopted to learn the user's current preferences, which are used to generate personalized playlists. Learning parameters are tuned by simulation of two hypothetical users. A two-month user study is conducted to evaluate the APG solutions. The results show that the proposed approach reduces the Miss Ratio by 10% in comparison with the baseline approach.","A novel trend emerged in music exploration is to organize and search songs according to their emotions.

196,1,0,2,1,Increasing Retrieval Quality in Conversational Recommenders,"A major task of research in conversational recommender systems is personalization. Critiquing is a common and powerful form of feedback, where a user can express her feature preferences by applying a series of directional critiques over the recommendations instead of providing specific preference values. Incremental Critiquing (IC) is a conversational recommender system that uses critiquing as a feedback to efficiently personalize products. The expectation is that in each cycle the system retrieves the products that best satisfy the user's soft product preferences from a minimal information input. In this paper, we present a novel technique that increases retrieval quality based on a combination of compatibility and similarity scores. Under the hypothesis that a user learns during the recommendation process, we propose two novel exponential Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for compatibility that take into account both the instant at which the user makes a critique and the number of satisfied critiques. Moreover, we consider that the impact of features on the similarity differs according to the preferences manifested by the user. We propose a Global Weighting (GW) approach that uses a common weight for nearest cases in order to focus on groups of relevant products. We show that our methodology significantly improves recommendation efficiency in four data sets of different sizes in terms of session length in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our recommender shows higher robustness against noisy user data when compared to classical approaches.","A major task of research in conversational recommender systems is personalization.

201,1,0,1,1,A Contextual Bandits Framework for Personalized Learning Action Selection.,"Recent developments in machine learning have the potential
to revolutionize education by providing an optimized, personalized
learning experience for each student. We study the
problem of selecting the best personalized learning action that
each student should take next given their learning history;
possible actions could include reading a textbook section,
watching a lecture video, interacting with a simulation or lab,
solving a practice question, and so on. We first estimate each
studentâs knowledge profile from their binary-valued graded
responses to questions in their previous assessments using
the SPARFA framework. We then employ these knowledge
profiles as contexts in the contextual (multi-armed) bandits
framework to learn a policy that selects the personalized
learning actions that maximize each studentâs immediate
success, i.e., their performance on their next assessment.
We develop two algorithms for personalized learning action
selection. While one is mainly of theoretical interest, we
experimentally validate the other using a real-world educational
dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves superior or comparable performance
as compared to existing algorithms in terms of maximizing
the studentsâ immediate success.",,,,,,,Author2,Author3,a,a,a,a,a,a,Intelligent Tutors,a,,,a,a,,http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2016/proceedings/paper_18.pdf,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/edm/LanB16,"Andrew S.

202,0,0,0,0,TacTex'13: A Champion Adaptive Power Trading Agent,"Sustainable energy systems of the future could no longer rely on the current paradigm that energy supply follows demand. Since many of the renewable energy resources do not produce power on demand, there is a need for new market structures that motivate sustainable behaviors by participants. The Power Trading Agent Competition(Power TAC) is a new annual competition that focuses on the design and operation of future retail power markets, specifically in smart grid environments with renewable energy production, smart metering, and autonomous agents acting on behalf of customers and retailers. It uses a rich, open-source simulation platform that is based on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making, as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. This research contributes to the former, by introducing TacTex'13, the champion agent from the inaugural competition in 2013. TacTex'13 learns and adapts to the environment in which it operates, by heavily relying on reinforcement-learning and prediction methods. We formalize the complex decision-making problem that TacTex'13 faces, and approximate its solution in TacTex'13's constituent components. We examine the success of the complete agent through analysis of competition results.","Sustainable energy systems of the future could no longer rely on the current paradigm that energy supply follows demand.

It uses a rich, open-source simulation platform that is based on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making, as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. This research contributes to the former, by introducing TacTex'13, the champion agent from the inaugural competition in 2013. TacTex'13 learns and adapts to the environment in which it operates, by heavily relying on reinforcement-learning and prediction methods. We formalize the complex decision-making problem that TacTex'13 faces, and approximate its solution in TacTex'13's constituent components. We examine the success of the complete agent through analysis of competition results.",,,,,"energy trading, machine learning, smart-grid",Author3,Author4,a,a,u,a,a,a,"Other (please in ""remark"")",a,domain: energy management,There is not real hint that this is personalized I think.,u,a,Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems,,,Daniel  Urieli and Peter  Stone,,,,,ACM-DL,0,,,1448,,,,,978-1-4503-2738-1,,,,,,2617516,,,,,,,1447--1448,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,,,,,1447,article,,,,,,2014,4,0,0,Author2

204,1,1,0,1,Learning User Preferences by Observing User-Items Interactions in an IoT Augmented Space,"Recommender systems generate recommendations by analysing which items the user consumes or likes. Moreover, in many scenarios, e.g., when a user is visiting an exhibition or a city, users are faced with a sequence of decisions, and the recommender should therefore suggest, at each decision step, a set of viable recommendations (attractions). In these scenarios the order and the context of the past user choices is a valuable source of data, and the recommender has to effectively exploit this information for understanding the user preferences in order to recommend compelling items.

For addressing these scenarios, this paper proposes a novel preference learning model that takes into account the sequential nature of item consumption. The model is based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning, which enables to exploit observations of users' behaviours, when they are making decisions and taking actions, i.e., choosing the items to consume. The results of a proof of concept experiment show that the proposed model can effectively capture the user preferences, the rationale of users decision making process when consuming items in a sequential manner, and can replicate the observed user behaviours.",,,,,,"cultural heritage, implicit feedback, internet of things, inverse reinforcement learning, museum, recommder systems, reinforcement learning, user modelling",Author2,Author3,a,a,a,a,a,a,Recommender Systems,a,,,a,a,"Adjunct Publication of the 25th Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization",,,David  Massimo and Mehdi  Elahi and Francesco  Ricci,,,,10.1145/3099023.3099070,ACM-DL,1,,,40,,,,,978-1-4503-5067-9,,,,,,3099070,,,,,,,35--40,,ACM,,,,,35,article,,,,,2017,2017,1,3,0,Author1

 time, DJ-MC exploits user feedback to initialize a model, which it 
subsequently updates by reinforcement. We evaluate our framework with 
human participants using both real song and playlist data. Our results

Simultaneously, energy end consumers become increasingly important as active prosumers.

LEM agents maximize their individual utility via automated Erev-Roth reinforcement learning. The learning strategies take into account the households' individual electricity preferences. To this end, agent preferences are grouped into truly greens, price-sensitive greens, and non adopters.

The user, due to a number of cognitive and technical reasons, is assumed to be initially uninformed over their preferences in the wireless domain. The solution we have developed is a closed-loop user-agent system that assists the user in application, task and context dependent service provisioning by adaptively and interactively learning to select the best wireless data service. The agent learns an incrementally revealed user preference model given explicit or implicit feedback on its decisions by the user. We model this closed-loop system as a Markov Decision Process, where the agent actions are rewarded by the user, and show how a reinforcement learning algorithm can be used to learn a model of the userÃ½s preferences on-line in the given allocation mechanism.

212,0,0,0,0,Demonstrating Cognitive Packet Network Resilience to Worm Attacks,"The need for network stability and reliability has led to the growth of autonomic networks that can provide more stable and more reliable communications via on-line measurement, learning and adaptation. A promising architecture is the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) that rapidly adapts to varying network conditions and user requirements using QoS driven reinforcement learning algorithms that drive the routing control. Contrary to conventional mechanisms, the users rather than the nodes, control the routing by specifying their desired QoS requirements (QoS Goals), such as Minimum Delay, Maximum Bandwidth, Minimum Cost, etc., and the network then routes each user's traffic individually based on their specific needs and on a ""glocal"" view. In CPN the user has the ability to explore the network for its own needs, and evaluate its own impact on the network as a whole and vice-versa, and then take appropriate decisions. CPN routing has been evaluated extensively under normal operating conditions and has proven to be very adaptive to network changes such as congestion. Here we show how CPN can respond and survive to catastrophic node failures caused by the spread of network worms. This survival is based on two complementary approaches that are run concurrently: one the one hand, each user attempts to concurrently and adaptively avoid paths which are infected, and secondly patching algorithms are continuously run to repair the network. Experiments show that this approach assures the stability of network communications throughout the course of an attack.

This strategy could be computed using supervised learning or contextual bandit algorithms, which treat two visits of the same user as two separate independent visitors, and thus, optimize greedily for a single step into the future. Another approach would be to use reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which differentiate between two visits of the same user and two different visitors, and thus, optimizes for multiple steps into the future or the life-time value (LTV) of a customer. While greedy methods have been well-studied, the LTV approach is still in its infancy, mainly due to two fundamental challenges: how to compute a good LTV strategy and how to evaluate a solution using historical data to ensure its âsafetyâ before deployment. In this paper, we tackle both of these challenges by proposing to use a family of off-policy evaluation techniques with statistical guarantees about the performance of a new strategy. We apply these methods to a real ad recommendation problem, both for evaluating the final performance and for optimizing the parameters of the RL algorithm.

However, there is no clear understanding of when and how many gold questions to insert. Typically, requesters mix a flat 10-30% of gold questions into the task stream of every worker. This static policy is arbitrary and wastes valuable budget --- the exact percentage is often chosen with little experimentation, and, more importantly, it does not adapt to individual workers, the current mixture of spamming vs. diligent workers, or the number of tasks workers perform before quitting.

We formulate the problem of balancing between (1) testing workers to determine their accuracy and (2) actually getting work performed as a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and apply reinforcement learning to dynamically calculate the best policy. Evaluations on both synthetic data and with real Mechanical Turk workers show that our agent learns adaptive testing policies that produce up to 111% more reward than the non-adaptive policies used by most requesters. Furthermore, our method is fully automated, easy to apply, and runs mostly out of the box.

219,1,0,1,1,Learning to Collaborate: Multi-Scenario Ranking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Ranking is a fundamental and widely studied problem in scenarios such as search, advertising, and recommendation. However, joint optimization for multi-scenario ranking, which aims to improve the overall performance of several ranking strategies in different scenarios, is rather untouched. Separately optimizing each individual strategy has two limitations. The first one is lack of collaboration between scenarios meaning that each strategy maximizes its own objective but ignores the goals of other strategies, leading to a sub-optimal overall performance. The second limitation is the inability of modeling the correlation between scenarios meaning that independent optimization in one scenario only uses its own user data but ignores the context in other scenarios. In this paper, we formulate multi-scenario ranking as a fully cooperative, partially observable, multi-agent sequential decision problem. We propose a novel model named Multi-Agent Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-RDPG) which has a communication component for passing messages, several private actors (agents) for making actions for ranking, and a centralized critic for evaluating the overall performance of the co-working actors. Each scenario is treated as an agent (actor). Agents collaborate with each other by sharing a global action-value function (the critic) and passing messages that encodes historical information across scenarios. The model is evaluated with online settings on a large E-commerce platform. Results show that the proposed model exhibits significant improvements against baselines in terms of the overall performance.

220,0,0,2,0,Personalizing a Dialogue System With Transfer Reinforcement Learning.,"It is difficult to train a personalized task-oriented dialogue system because the data collected from each individual is often insufficient. Personalized dialogue systems trained on a small dataset can overfit and make it difficult to adapt to different user needs. One way to solve this problem is to consider a collection of multiple users' data as a source domain and an individual user's data as a target domain, and to perform a transfer learning from the source to the target domain. By following this idea, we propose ""PETAL""(PErsonalized Task-oriented diALogue), a transfer-learning framework based on POMDP to learn a personalized dialogue system. The system first learns common dialogue knowledge from the source domain and then adapts this knowledge to the target user. This framework can avoid the negative transfer problem by considering differences between source and target users. The policy in the personalized POMDP can learn to choose different actions appropriately for different users. Experimental results on a real-world coffee-shopping data and simulation data show that our personalized dialogue system can choose different optimal actions for different users, and thus effectively improve the dialogue quality under the personalized setting.","It is difficult to train a personalized task-oriented dialogue system because the data collected from each individual is often insufficient.

The agent employs Machine Learning techniques to customize itself to the userâs personal scheduling rules and preferences by ob- serving the userâs actions and receiving direct user- feedback. Our approach provides the user with sophis- ticated control over the gradual delegation of schedul- ing tasks to the agent, as a trust relationship is built. We report upon an experiment in which a collection of such assistants became gradually more helpful to their users through the use of memory-based and reinforce- ment learning. The experimental data reported upon demonstrate that the learning approach to building in- telligent interface agents is a very promising one which has several advantages over more standard approaches.

Yet, stress affects people differently and everyone manages stress in different ways. In this paper we introduce PeSA, the Personality-enabled Stress Assistant, an agent-based application that accounts for this individualism. PeSA merges several agent techniques: Reinforcement learning is used to learn about preferences of the users, prior knowledge and knowledge transfer is applied to accelerate the learning process, agent mirroring helps to enable communication and offline functionalities. Based on these mechanisms, PeSA guides through stressful phases by proposing coping strategies that are tailored to the personality of each individual user. Users can assess these advices and thus provide a reward or punishment signal that helps PeSA to improve its suggestions.",,,,,,"human-agent teamwork, human-behaviour models, reinforcement learning",Author3,Author4,a,a,a,a,a,a,Personal Assistants,a,,,a,a,Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents &#38; Multiagent Systems,,,Sebastian  Ahrndt and Marco  L&#252;tzenberger and Stephen M.

230,2,1,1,1,"Reinforcement Learning: The Sooner the Better, or the Later the Better?","Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the best machine learning approaches for decision making in interactive environments. RL focuses on inducing effective decision making policies with the goal of maximizing the agent's cumulative reward. In this study, we investigated the impact of both immediate and delayed reward functions on RL-induced policies and empirically evaluated the effectiveness of induced policies within an Intelligent Tutoring System called Deep Thought. Moreover, we divided students into Fast and Slow learners based on their incoming competence as measured by their average response time on the initial tutorial level. Our results show that there was a significant interaction effect between the induced policies and the students' incoming competence. More specifically, Fast learners are less sensitive to learning environments in that they can learn equally well regardless of the pedagogical strategies employed by the tutor, but Slow learners benefit significantly more from effective pedagogical strategies than from ineffective ones. In fact, with effective pedagogical strategies the slow learners learned as much as their faster peers, but with ineffective pedagogical strategies the former learned significantly less than the latter.",,,,,,"delayed reward, immediate reward, pedagogical strategy, problem solving, reinforcement learning, worked example",Author3,Author4,a,a,a,a,a,a,Intelligent Tutors,a,This work seems to only fit our definition of personalization when we view two categories of learners ('fast' and 'slow') sufficiently `personalized'.,"Indeed, I guess it's personalization over groups, which should be fine.",a,a,Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on User Modeling Adaptation and Personalization,,,Shitian  Shen and Min  Chi,,,,10.1145/2930238.2930247,ACM-DL,1,,,44,,,,,978-1-4503-4368-8,,,,,,2930247,,,,,,,37--44,,ACM,,,,,37,article,,,,,2016,2016,0,3,1,Author1

232,0,0,0,0,An Agent-based Model of Regional Food Supply Chain Disintermediation,"Regional  food  hubs  provide  logistics services  for  small  and  mid-sized food  producers,  giving  them  the  ability to reach larger markets and customers than they can reach on their own. However, once food hub managers  have  helped  to  establish  connections  between  producers  and  new  customers,  they  often  find  themselves cut out of the regional food supply chain when the farmers decide to sell their products directly to the customers, thereby avoiding the food hubâs service fees. Widespread disintermediation can eventually lead to food hub failure, which can disrupt the entire regional food system.  This paper describes an agent-based model that incorporates reinforcement learning to study disintermediation behavior in a regional food supply network in Iowa. The model is designed to serve as a decision support tool for food hub managers, allowing them to simulate the effects of various supply chain management strategies on producer decision making and long-term system success.

Vol. 76","Statistical Methods for Dynamic Treatment Regimes shares state of the art of statistical methods developed to address questions of estimation and inference for dynamic treatment regimes, a branch of personalized medicine. This volume demonstrates these methods with their conceptual underpinnings and illustration through analysis of real and simulated data. These methods are immediately applicable to the practice of personalized medicine, which is a medical paradigm that emphasizes the systematic use of individual patient information to optimize patient health care. This is the first single source to provide an overview of methodology and results gathered from journals, proceedings, and technical reports with the goal of orienting researchers to the field. The first chapter establishes context for the statistical reader in the landscape of personalized medicine. Readers need only have familiarity with elementary calculus, linear algebra, and basic large-sample theory to use this text. Throughout the text, authors direct readers to available code or packages in different statistical languages to facilitate implementation. In cases where code does not already exist, the authors provide analytic approaches in sufficient detail that any researcher with knowledge of statistical programming could implement the methods from scratch. This will be an important volume for a wide range of researchers, including statisticians, epidemiologists, medical researchers, and machine learning researchers interested in medical applications. Advanced graduate students in statistics and biostatistics will also find material in Statistical Methods for Dynamic Treatment Regimes to be a critical part of their studies.",,,,,,,Author4,Author1,a,a,a,a,u,a,,,"This is a book in the series 'statistical methods for biology and health'.
